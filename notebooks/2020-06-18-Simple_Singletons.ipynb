A nice example might be a configuration class, or a coordinator class that is used by various pieces of you code, and you want to make sure that they're all pointing to the same instance without having to pass the object around in eery invocation!\n",

But then we'd be breaking scope, and that is **bad**. Global variables should be avoided like the plague in structured code like this. So how can we request the same instance, without having global state?"

And then it gets back to `x=1`, but because we said `maxsize=2` (ie only remember the last two unique runs), it had cleared out the saved `x=1` run, and has to do it again. Of course, `maxsize=2` is a tiny number, and you can bump this up to some power of 2 that is more useful. One thing to take note of is that any function you want to cache like this has to have hashable inputs. So numbers, strings (primitives in general), however generic objects without hashes will not be able to be saved, and you'll see a warning. \n",
