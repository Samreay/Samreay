As readers of this genre know, LitRPG worlds can be a depressing, harrowing, and cut-throat place. Half of the MC's I've read in other works get ahead because this suits them just fine. They're happen to fight, happy get their hands dirty, happy to shake the system up. In many ways, that's part of the escapism. Having power. 

*Cinnamon Bun* has a slightly different take. The world is less apocalyptic in fashion, and our main character, Broccoli Bunch, just wants to go on cool adventures and make friends. She's been transported to a new world, but thankfully the original Earth is going fine. Her parents and friends haven't all died, never to be dealt with again. No, this is a wholesome story.

Broccoli doesn't like violence, you see. Friends are better.

If only more people were like Broccoli. 

We follow Broccoli around as she makes friends and engages in various levels of hijinks. She makes friends with a harpy, Amaryllis, and then a human noble, Awen. The characters are distinct in tone, voice, and motivations. Secondary characters come and go, and make the world feel very lived in. 

It may take a while for the stakes to get a bit higher than personal levels, but let's be honest - you're probably not reading Cinnamon Bun for world-ending stakes. You're reading it because it gives you that warm, happy feeling inside, that sometimes you really just need after a long and tiring day at work. 

If that sounds like a good time to you, rejoice, because RavensDagger has plenty of other wholesome and feel-good works out there. Go check them out.
