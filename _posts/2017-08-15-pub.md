Physics in the Pub came to Brisbane! With the esteemed Dr Phil Dooley as MC for the night, we had
a great evening of eight physics acts. Whilst I trying to impress the sheer scale and significance
of supernovae on the audience, I was definitely not the star of the show that night!

[Chris Mesiku](http://archive-hapi.uq.edu.au/chris-mesiku) sang a reggae song about $$E=mc^2$$ and Einstein. Phil 
himself sang a cover of Nirvana about particle physics and light.

I think if I do it again I obviously need to present, if not in song, in verse at least!

The entire night is available on Youtube here if you were interested thanks to Till:
