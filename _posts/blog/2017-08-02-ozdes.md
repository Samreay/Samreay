Sometimes I think I get a big bogged down, lost in a maze of code
that I used to be the master of before losing my bearing. At times like this,
it is prudent to take a step back, to let the maze untangle itself slowly
whilst one focuses on other tasks.

Or at least, that is my excuse for picking up side work. In the latest installment
of "No, I don't have results from my PhD yet," I present the following post on OzDES, its purpose,
goals and how it goes about fulfilling them. The poster will be printed and displayed
in Canberra in one of the final events for CAASTRO. But maybe it's
also of interest to non-politicians, so here it is!
