I highly recommend this experience to all other CAASTRO students. I was
only at Ayers Rock Resort for a week and enjoyed myself immensely. The
time you have to talk to the general public, play educational games
with the kids, answer interesting questions at the AstroTours and
take your own pictures of the night sky makes it a great experience.

I was an emergency replacement, hence why I went for one week and not 
two, however one week was plenty of time to settle into a comfortable
routine focused on public outreach. I managed to get a couple of 
nice shots of the Milky Way and the Southern Cross.

Then one night it clouded over and the astro tour was cancelled,
which meant I was put to the Field of Light tour to answer
any possible questions. But the clouds stifled any questions, 
and so I got to simply wander. Which was nice.

I gave a public lecture on black holes and our methods of
finding them too, which was fun!
