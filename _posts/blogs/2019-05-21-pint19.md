I did Pint of Science originally in 2017 and had a blast. For 2018, I was 
stranded on a beach in Fiji and unable to participate. But for 2019, I 
was all in!

And because the original talk seemed to go down so well, I decided to
try and challenge myself a bit more by picking a topic far harder
for a general audience to visualise. I decided to talk about
Baryon Acoustic Oscillations - frozen sound waves in space. 

For those interested in the technical details, check out
my [project post on BAO](https://cosmiccoding.com.au/project/2015/10/20/bao.html). Luckily for me,
alcohol smooths over many things, and it wasn't too bad a talk.

I've decided to make the one next year even better.
