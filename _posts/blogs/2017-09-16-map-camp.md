Presenting, a desert camp, with included outcrops, interior cave and hole of mystery!

Once again, following the style of Mark Bowen's maps over at [Blue Sword Games](https://www.patreon.com/blueswordgames),
my second desert map.

I decided I wanted the map to have a few potential uses.

* Make camp, and be ambused from outside, and use the cave choke point to hold them off.
* Have creatures ascend from the hole and attack the camp from inside the cave.
* Both of the above!
* Have the cave already occupied when trying to make camp.
* Use the hole to descend into a cave map (coming next).

So, for this map, here are the outlines and grid versions:

And if the previous ones are too dark, here is a slightly lighter one:
