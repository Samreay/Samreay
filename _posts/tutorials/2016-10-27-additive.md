A problem I have encountered several times is how to nicely plot a large amount of data points
in matplotlib and be able to nicely show the density of the data points. The normal method is simple:
just plot the data points with their opacity set down, and then you can see the data points overlap.

The issue I have with this is that at some point after your stack a few data points, you reach `alpha=1` and
then you may as well not both to show any more data points. Here is an example of this, when I simply try
and plot twenty thousand realisations of a simple multivariate normal.


``` python
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Sample our data
n = 20000
np.random.seed(0)
x = np.random.normal(size=n)
y = np.random.normal(size=n)

# Create a figure with the axis filling it, with a black background
fig = plt.figure(figsize=(8,6))
ax = fig.add_subplot(111, axisbg="#000000")
fig.subplots_adjust(0, 0, 1, 1)

# Plot our data points
ax.scatter(x, y, alpha=0.3, c="b", lw=0)

# Save it out, without whitespace and labels getting in the way
ax.get_xaxis().set_visible(False)
ax.get_yaxis().set_visible(False)
fig.savefig("bad.png", pad_inches=0, bbox_inches="tight")
```

This leaves a lot to be desired. So what I wanted to do was to implement [additive blending](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blend_modes#Addition),
a technique I use a lot in Photoshop and After Effects. However, search as I might it seems that this
not something that simply comes with matplotlib. [My initial query to StackOverflow](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/33728154/additive-blending-in-matplotlib)
went unanswered, but I did find a similar question [here](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/26702176/is-it-possible-to-do-additive-blending-with-matplotlib),
and my implementation closely follows this.

So what have to do the additive blending ourselves if we want it, which is a pain. Straightforward,
but a pain nonetheless. Example code is shown below, and hopefully the commenting on it explains
what I am doing sufficiently. The gist of it is that you have to render layers
yourself, stack them manually and then display the final image buffer using `imshow`.

``` python
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Sample our data
n = 20000
np.random.seed(0)
x = np.random.normal(size=n)
y = np.random.normal(size=n)

# Create a figure with the axis filling it, with a black background
fig = plt.figure(figsize=(8,6))
ax = fig.add_subplot(111, axisbg="#000000")
fig.subplots_adjust(0, 0, 1, 1)

# Draw the empty axis, which we use as a base.
fig.canvas.draw()
w, h = fig.canvas.get_width_height()
buffer = np.frombuffer(fig.canvas.buffer_rgba(), np.uint8)
first = buffer.astype(np.int16).reshape(h, w, -1) #int16 so we dont overflow
first[first[:, :, -1] == 0] = 0 # Set transparent pixels to 0

layers = 20 # Number of layers to add. Higher numbers are better but slower
for i in range(layers):
    ax.clear()
    ax.patch.set_facecolor("#000000")
    ax.scatter(x[i::layers], y[i::layers], alpha=0.3, c="#1E3B9C", lw=0)
    fig.canvas.draw()
    img = np.frombuffer(fig.canvas.buffer_rgba(), np.uint8).astype(np.int16).reshape(h, w, -1)
    img[img[:, :, -1] == 0] = 0
    first += img # Add these particles to the main layer
    
first = np.clip(first, 0, 255) # Clip buffer back to int8 range

ax.clear()
plt.axis("off")
ax.imshow(first.astype(np.uint8), aspect='auto')
fig.savefig("good.png", pad_inches=0)
```

Same data points as the first plot, but now not only are the individual data points clearer
overall, even in the dense sections, but we also have a better gauge of the distribution
due to the brighter center.
