As part of The Science Nation's National Science Week set of activities, I was given
the opportunity to participate in *Battle of the Brains*! Andrew Stephenson hosted the
event, and kept the six guest scientists neatly in line throughout the event.

We set up on stage, I of course didn't speak into the microphone correctly, and an audience 
member came up and adjusted it mid-sentence to much laughter.

It was a great night where I got nearly every question wrong! The highlight was the
final question Steveo put to each team:

<p class="highlighted">How many breaths of air are there on the planet?</p>

This is [Fermi problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fermi_problem), and I'm happy to report that, rounded 
to the nearest magnitude, both panels came to exactly the same answer: $$10^{23}$$. Which, surprisingly, is the correct
one!
