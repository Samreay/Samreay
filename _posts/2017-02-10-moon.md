I was at the Dark Energy Survey conference in December when I met an overachieving student. Three years in,
and already using the telescope at the University of Sussex to do additional projects, including a moon mosaic.

Jessica, the student in question, had never made a mosaic before. Luckily, I had done it once or twice
for past work for Gemini, and so I offered to help. Three hundred images I received of the moon. I threw out almost
two hundred with high PSFs, and from the remaining 100 told Photoshop to get to work. It took literally the entire day,
and I think I might have melted some of the internal components. But after it finished and I manually cleaned up some
of the arrangement failures, the final result was pretty nice!
