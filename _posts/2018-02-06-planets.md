This was a scene in which I learnt a lot, not just about compositing. Lots of fiddling with materials, mapping
and textures to get the rocky planets working.

And then even more fiddling for the Gas Giants, to try and get that characteristic atmospheric effect
along the boundary of the planet surface.

Setting up Saturn's ring was a pain with the UV mapping, but eventually got it working!

And then figuring out how to do heat displacement (render a second layer where the Sun is textured
with coloured noise, where I select only the red and animate the hue to give the impression of evolving noise), 
plus plenty of ghosts, glare and blurring to give the impression of brightness.

I'd show the node layouts, but they are huge sprawling messes, so I'll pass on that this time. Instead, 
have the final video below. I set the timing to the Space Odyssey theme, and it's quite loud!
