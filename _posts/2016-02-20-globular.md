In my time over at Gemini in La Serena, I worked on a project
to distinguish globular clusters from stars. The globular clusters (GCs)
were located in the giant elliptical galaxy Maffei 1, which - whilst
being very close to us - requires looking through the middle of our 
galaxy.

You do not want this.

The dust extinction was through the roof. I used the SDFRED data
reduction pipeline to process images from the Subaru telescope, giving
me the output image below.

Now instead of going into more detail in thos post, I still
have access to the presentation I gave at the end of my work there,
having fairly successfully implemented various machine learning
algorithms to classify objects as either globular clusters or not
(the not being a combination of stars and galaxies) using feature
extraction from SExtractor. So here it is:
