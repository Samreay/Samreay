[Famelab](https://www.britishcouncil.org.au/famelab) is a science communication challenge
where PhD students have three minutes, no slides, no video and one prop - if they 
so choose - to share your thesis work to a live audience!

I prepared a short segment on supernovae and their role in the universe. But before the night
itself, we had a short segement with Rebecca Levingston on ABC's 
[Saturday Breakfast radio](http://www.abc.net.au/radio/brisbane/programs/saturdaybreakfast/). It was my first
radio spot, and I admit I was definitely not as eloquent as I wanted!

The night itself was great, I actually managed to do alright. Only forgot one whole section of
my speech, but no one noticed.

If anyone wants to share their project work to an audience interested in science in general, I 
highly recommend doing the event!
