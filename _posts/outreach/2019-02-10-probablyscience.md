It turns out when you throw three comedians together on stage its super hard to keep 
up with the banter! I was the guest scientist invite on the amazing 
[Probably Science](http://www.probablyscience.com/) podcast.

The episode should be up soon, give it a listen when it comes out, especially if
you have a love for koalas.
