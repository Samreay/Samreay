During the week of the 14th of May there were a host of Pint of Science events 
presented in Brisbane. Josh and I did one together - Josh presented a talk *Dark matter, what's the matter?*,
where he talked about the dark universe, and potential candidates for dark matter. I 
gave a talk *The Brightest Fireworks in the Universe* - on supernovae, their lives, deaths and
role in the universe. 

These are apparently hot topics, as we sold out the room, reorganised to fit more people, and then sold out
again! And whilst it was good to know so many people were interested, it was also intimidating to know that there
were now well over a hundred people in the Loft with the sole purpose of listening to us speak!

Luckily, it went well (apart from an attempted sabotage by Microsoft), and I look forward to
next time the event is run in Brisbane!
