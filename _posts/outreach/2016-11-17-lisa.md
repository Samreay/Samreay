In November 2016, Lisa Randall gave an Australian tour in the big cities. As normal for ThinkInc
events, they had a local scientist give an introductory talk to warm up the audience.

I decided to give a brief talk about the current state of physics, and gave a brief
explanation of the physics behind the Hubble Space Telescope, the Large Hadron Collider, 
eLISA, LIGO and a few other great experiments.

Unfortunately I was unable to get the recording for the event, so all I have 
to show for it is the original promotional image I was given to promote the event!
