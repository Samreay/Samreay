In November I gave one of the monthly public lectures for UQ's 
BrisScience event. We had a good little chat for the hour, first
going over the history of the universe.

Fourteen minutes for fourteen billion years of cosmic history, sounds
doable, right? Well, you need context to appreciate the second half of 
the talk.

That second half was then a very short introduction to dark
energy and dark matter. What they *might* be, why we believe so 
strongly that they exist

If you're curious about the talk itself, well, turns out 
that you can watch it online, on this fancy thing called YouTube!
