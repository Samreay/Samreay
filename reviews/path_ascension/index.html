It&rsquo;s only on Royal Road (at the time of writing), but I hope it reaches a wider audience soon when the author has a chance to go back and package it all up nicely.</p><p><em>The Path of Ascension</em> follows the journey of our tragically orphaned MC, Matt. Matt&rsquo;s parents were killed in a rift break. If you&rsquo;ve read <em>Solo Levelling</em> or many other rift/portal/dunegon based novels, this is fairly standard. Don&rsquo;t keep a rift (dungeon) under control, eventually things come out of it and start killing.</p><p>Our MC gets his abilities awakened, but&mdash;oh no&mdash;it&rsquo;s given a bad rating, so now he won&rsquo;t get picked up by a guild to help him through his spiritual journey. But through the power of hard-work and sheer determination, Matt impresses some powerful sponsors, and they throw him into a high-tech Empire-run PlayPen. This is a prestigious academy, similar to where Rei goes in <em>Iron Prince</em>, very combat focused.</p><p>A few chapters in, Matt gets his second ability, and oh boy is it a doozie. It makes his power exponentially increasing as he tiers up. People start at Tier 1, Tier 15 is immortality (no aging), Tier 25 is &ldquo;wipe out a planet easily&rdquo; and it goes up to Tier 50, which is what the Emperor is. His power doubles with each tier, so obviously&mdash;if he survives and tiers up a lot&mdash;he is going to be an absolute monster.</p><p>Now theres a whole bunch of confusion (and maybe even inconsistency) with the power levels. Initially the author writes that the levels are exponential in most things. For example, 10 Tier 1 mana gems go are worth a Tier 2. At higher Tiers, the ratio is 50-to-1, not 10-to-1, which meant I was a bit confused as to how Matt&rsquo;s power doubling every tier was supposed to be good, if the expectation was that each tier is ten times stronger than the last. Some of this gets clarified/retconned, at one point the author even drops in a formula showing one aspect (mana concentrations impact on spell potency) follows a log scale, but all-in-all apart from &ldquo;bigger number is more powerful,&rdquo; I don&rsquo;t really know how its supposed to work. That&rsquo;s one of the issues when you put numbers to something, is that&mdash;once defined&mdash;its so much harder to make everything consistent.</p><p>Power confusion aside, Matt is quickly joined on his journey with a bond (animal companion, like a sacred beast bond in <em>Cradle</em>), and then later on with a female companion, Liz. The romance is done quite well actually, apart from some weird things like the position to not have sex for seventy years, despite them being in a progressive, futuristic, sexually-free society. But overall, this is one of the romances plot lines I like, for it grows out of friendship, understanding, and respect, it doesn&rsquo;t just appear like magic.</p><p>Onto the plot, I wish there was a bit more of an external impetus to keep things going, and some of the arcs do feel far more serious and others. I loved the rift experimentation mini-arc, and it gave strong Corin Cadence vibes from <em>Arcane Ascension</em>.</p><p>Outside of the main characters, there&rsquo;s definitely an issue with underdeveloped secondary characters stemming from a too-large cast, and even after more than a hundred chapters, I still couldn&rsquo;t tell you who&rsquo;s who in the secondary team that Matt befriends in the PlayPen, apart from Melinda, who is the super overpowered healer.</p><p>Hopefully those characters get some more development in upcoming chapters rather than being shipped off to some far-off world. I&rsquo;ll update this review when I know, because I full intend on checking back each week and consuming each chapter as they come. It&rsquo;s not perfect, but god am I a sucker for scifi, Wuxia, and I&rsquo;ll read until Matt can power a whole damn planet himself.</p></div><div class=mt-20><p class=text-center><a href=/reviews>For more book reviews, click here!</a></p></div><div class=mt-20><div class="relative max-w-xl mx-auto my-20"><div class="fancy_card horizontal"><div class=card_translator><div class="card_rotator tiny_rot card_layer"><div class="card_layer newsletter p-2"><div class="newsletter-inner h-full"><div class="relative h-full sib-form-container" id=sib-form-container><div class="mb-6 lg:mb-12 text-center"><h3 class="text-main-200 mb-2 lg:mb-8">Stay in the loop!</h3><p class="text-main-100 text-lg text-opacity-70">For new releases, exclusive giveaways, and reviews.</p></div><form action="https://Cosmiccoding.us5.list-manage.com/subscribe/post?u=aebe5de1d2e40dccb3aeca491&id=3987dd4a1f" method=post id=mc-embedded-subscribe-form name=mc-embedded-subscribe-form class="validate w-full" target=_blank novalidate><div><input type=email class="w-full appearance-none bg-main-600 mb-4 border border-main-600 bg-opacity-5 focus:border-main-300 rounded-sm px-4 py-3 text-main-100 placeholder-main-100 required" placeholder="Your best email…" aria-label="Your best email…" name=EMAIL required data-required=true id=EMAIL><div style=position:absolute;left:-5000px aria-hidden=true><input type=text name=b_aebe5de1d2e40dccb3aeca491_3987dd4a1f tabindex=-1></div><input type=submit value=Subscribe name=subscribe id=mc-embedded-subscribe class="button btn bg-main-600 hover:bg-main-400 shadow w-full"></div><p id=mce-error-response style=display:none class="text-center mt-2 opacity-50 text-main-200">There was a problem, please try again.</p><p id=mce-success-response style=display:none class="text-center mt-2 opacity-50 text-main-200">Thanks mate, won't let ya down.</p></form></div></div></div><div class="card_layer card_effect card_soft_glare" style=pointer-events:none></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div><script language=javascript type=text/javascript src=https://cosmiccoding.com.au/js/main.min.11673d10a962fb5205229607e62ea1d23424d35dad33db7bfe2a09a63d5409fa.js></script>
