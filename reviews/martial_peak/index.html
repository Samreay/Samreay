In the face of adversity, you must survive and remain unyielding. Only then can you break through and continue on your journey to become the strongest. Sky Tower tests its disciples in the harshest ways to prepare them for this journey. One day the lowly sweeper Yang Kai managed to obtain a black book, setting him on the road to the peak of the martial world.</p><h2 id=thoughts>Thoughts</h2><p>This is my first proper manhua and I thought I&rsquo;d bounce off it. Well, hundreds of chapters, tens of thousands of pages later, I&rsquo;m still going. It&rsquo;s <em>addictive</em>.</p><p>If you thought stories like DotF or HWFWM are about popcorn, no no, they have fluff. Fluff called writing. Remove all those big paragraphs, get some great art, and every new chapter has a new realm, fight, pill, artifact, breakthrough, waifu, or mysterious master.</p><p>There&rsquo;s been so much content I don&rsquo;t really know how to summarise it. In general, larger arcs follow the pattern of:</p><ol><li>Wow look at these cool new places</li><li>Oh no, Yang Kai isn&rsquo;t the strongest, let&rsquo;s start fixing that</li><li>Accumulate artifacts/resources/pills.</li><li>Look at this woman with giant tits. Let&rsquo;s wife her.</li><li>Breakthrough as many times as needed.</li><li>Oh no, there&rsquo;s a realm above this one? Can&rsquo;t have that. Go to new realm. Repeat from step one.</li></ol><p>It is both a bit derivative to have the same overarching structure, but each realm and the problems with it <em>are</em> different enough that I didn&rsquo;t get bored. For example, the Yang family war as a means of securing resources is very different to Yang Kai constructing space teleportation arrays to join worlds together.</p><p>Yang Kai is himself a pretty good protagonist. He&rsquo;s not a complete murder hobo, but he <em>does</em> murder when he needs to. The concept of &lsquo;face&rsquo; is everywhere (as is normal in more traditional works), and Yang Kai is no exception. Or to quote the translated novel:</p><blockquote><p>He wasn&rsquo;t addicted to killing, but some people were addicted to courting death.</p></blockquote><p>Outside of Yang Kai, most reoccurring characters are his wives. There&rsquo;s no NSFW content (apart from revealing outfits). It&rsquo;s not like some web serial harems where woman <em>throw</em> themselves at the MC, instead Yang Kai forms relationships (often entirely without the sexual side being shown or implied) over the course of a realm arc, which if we convert to &ldquo;page count&rdquo; would be in the thousands of pages. At that slower pace, things feel a little more natural, especially given Yang Kai ends up being >10k years old. The multiple romantic interests does provide some humour sometimes as well.</p><p></p><p>Going with the multiple women, the sexual conservatism of many eastern works comes through, where women are routinely slut shamed, which is perhaps my biggest annoyance with the series.</p><p>To refocus on the good, the art style is amazing. The translations are above average, and then pacing is almost always extraordinarily fast-paced. So head over to whatever place you normally use to read manga, and give the first few chapters a shot.</p></div><div class=mt-20><p class=text-center><a href=/reviews>For more book reviews, click here!</a></p></div><div class=mt-20><div class="relative max-w-xl mx-auto my-20"><div class="fancy_card horizontal"><div class=card_translator><div class="card_rotator tiny_rot card_layer"><div class="card_layer newsletter p-2"><div class="newsletter-inner h-full"><div class="relative h-full sib-form-container" id=sib-form-container><div class="mb-6 lg:mb-12 text-center"><h3 class="text-main-200 mb-2 lg:mb-8">Stay in the loop!</h3><p class="text-main-100 text-lg text-opacity-70">For new releases, exclusive giveaways, and reviews.</p></div><form action="https://Cosmiccoding.us5.list-manage.com/subscribe/post?u=aebe5de1d2e40dccb3aeca491&id=3987dd4a1f" method=post id=mc-embedded-subscribe-form name=mc-embedded-subscribe-form class="validate w-full" target=_blank novalidate><div><input type=email class="w-full appearance-none bg-main-600 mb-4 border border-main-600 bg-opacity-5 focus:border-main-300 rounded-sm px-4 py-3 text-main-100 placeholder-main-100 required" placeholder="Your best email…" aria-label="Your best email…" name=EMAIL required data-required=true id=EMAIL><div style=position:absolute;left:-5000px aria-hidden=true><input type=text name=b_aebe5de1d2e40dccb3aeca491_3987dd4a1f tabindex=-1></div><input type=submit value=Subscribe name=subscribe id=mc-embedded-subscribe class="button btn bg-main-600 hover:bg-main-400 shadow w-full"></div><p id=mce-error-response style=display:none class="text-center mt-2 opacity-50 text-main-200">There was a problem, please try again.</p><p id=mce-success-response style=display:none class="text-center mt-2 opacity-50 text-main-200">Thanks mate, won't let ya down.</p></form></div></div></div><div class="card_layer card_effect card_soft_glare" style=pointer-events:none></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div><script language=javascript type=text/javascript src=https://cosmiccoding.com.au/js/main.min.11673d10a962fb5205229607e62ea1d23424d35dad33db7bfe2a09a63d5409fa.js></script>
