*As of the time of writing this review, I have read the available chapters (chapter 40).*

## Blurb

> *Two Lives, Two Souls, Both forced down into their roles,*
> 
> *One in the Light, One in the Dark, As the Fates portend,*
> 
> *One to uphold, one to turn over the Mores,*
> 
> *Would they Save the World, or Bring it to its End?*

A story where things might not be what they seem like.

Several high school students found their lives suddenly turned upside down when they were summoned to another world as \[Heroes\]. One found themselves before an entity that only recalled memories of eldritch gods, and found themselves changed into something else altogether. Circumstances forced the former friends into opposing sides, each finding out more from their own side of the story.

In the end, who told the truth? Who fed them with lies? What was best for the world they had been brought to? All were answers they have to find for themselves.


## Thoughts

During the first chapter the story seemed to be intent on ticking off every trope possible. Sporting, social, and academic legend Alyissa is summoned to a fantasy world as its Chosen Hero. Her big football friend is summoned too, as a Warrior. Arrogant, elitist, snob Joshua is the Mage... and then, tragically, recently departed Esperanza, meant to be the Cleric, garners the attention of the Old Gods, and reincarnates effectively as a Lovecraftian abomination that is quickly killed, along with the tropiness of the story.

Thankfully, all our heros have the Respawn skill.

This sets up an interesting dynamic and future conflict. On one side, the three champions being power levelled by the kingdom that summoned them. 

On the other hand, Esperanza in a forest of monsters levelling solo.

Alas, the story is still in early stages, so the two parties haven't met up yet.

The worldbuilding seems fairly detailed, although most of the information does come to the reader through exposition-like telepathic chats between Esperanza and the Old Gods, which is probably my main "I wish this was done differently." Granted, it *makes sense*. If I was in the same position and could chat with some gods, I'd 100% ask questions and listen to the answers. But as a reader, it feels too easy. Where is that organic revelation about the nature of the world over an authorative deity just letting you know how it is?

The back and forth perspectives (between Alyssia and Esperanza) may be offputting to some readers that prefer the laser-focused single-MC-perspective common to web serials. I didn't mind it, but then again I also loved ASoIAF and Malazan, which have scores of different perspectives. Having two PoVs was a nice change of pace, especially because they are ostensibly acting towards opposite goals.

I won't detail those goals, because that would be a large spoiler, but its dropped in the first few chapters during an Esperanza-Old-God chat.

In terms of the system and mechanics, it's got the normal stats, classes, skills, along with class and skill evolution. Stats haven't been too important explicitly yet, but the skills and classes are the main mechanic characters build around. I'm very keen to see where Esperanza takes her flesh shaping abilities and how her classes and skills evolve, because there are a lot of fun things the author could do with them.

On that note, I've finished all public chapters, so I'm going to let this one build up for another month or two and then jump back in and hope the two groups meet up by then so I can see the fireworks.
