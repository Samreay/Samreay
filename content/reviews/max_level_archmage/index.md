## Blurb


Vivienne has poured so many hours into the massively popular VRMMO The Seven Cataclysms that she has more of a life inside the game than out. It's a fitting irony, then, when one day she wakes in the body of her maxed-out demon-mage 'Vivisari'—and finds that now, the game really is her life.

But the world of Seven Cataclysms isn't what she remembers. A hundred years have passed since the game's concluding events, and Vivisari is a hero of myth thought long dead. As she meets old faces and new in this familiar-yet-not world—casting spells of mass destruction and slowly reforming the scattered-to-the-wind remnants of her Guild—she starts to wonder if she was sent here with a purpose.

Rumors of a sequel had been circulating just before her unbelievable reincarnation. Did she, perhaps, need to fear an impending Eighth Cataclysm?

If so, it's a good thing she has firepower in spades.



## Thoughts

*As of writing this review, I've read all 51 public chapters.*

God *damn* this is so well executed. You want all those overpower MC tropes? Young apprentice tropes? Magic academy tropes? Crafting tropes? This story is a damned masterpiece in distilling everything that people love about the power fantasy side of the genre and executing it with the precision of a surgeon.

In future, when people ask me "I have an idea, does it matter if it's been done before?" I am point to point them to the staggering success this serial had so quickly, stroke my imaginary beard, and mutter "Execution is everything."

Funnily enough, the closest start I can think of to mirror this series is actually Overlord, but instead of a massive skeleton overlord called Ainz Ooal Gown, we have the itty bitty tiny little demon Vivisari. Similar to Overlord, the primary LitRPG theme comes from the VRMMO origin of the world, and the use of [Skills] and item levels/rarity. Vivi doesn't really care about levels or experience (she has too much already, though Sasha does level up I guess), and apart from some initial VeryBigNumbers to press home the unfathomable amount of mana and magical might the MC has, they don't really appear again. There's no "Oh I cast Fireball with 10000000 mana and now I'm down to 93% my reserves of X/Y" etc etc. It's not Delve, the LitRPG is not crunchy.

As such, I sort of wish that the story just did away with it already. There would be absolutely minimal changes in global plot if the world had nothing to do with a VRMMO initially, but then it wouldn't quite hit some peoples nostalgia button properly I'm guessing. And obviously having an MC from Earth does provide a handy vehicle for the author to justify any exposition needed and also make use of similies, comparisons, and sayings that you'd have to invent from scratch in a pure fantasy world.

This is unrelated to my main grevious with the series. Even if you jump to patreon, there are only 59 chapters! I read *everything* in one afternoon. ONE! And while I can't throw stones in this glass house of mine (if anyone is reading this and wondering where my next book is I'm working on it I promiseeeee) but dayum the pacing and the chapter hooks are just so beautifully done that I didn't find a single spot where I was content to put the book down and continue reading it the next day. I just read and read until it was 1am and the "Next Chapter" button stopped working and then I stared at the ceiling, grumpy, for at least another hour.

Right, so just go read this. There's a reason it's on its way to 20k followers and five billion patreons (yes that's envy you're hearing), and it's because its addictive as hell.
