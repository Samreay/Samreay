## Blurb

In the year 2057, the world has become a corporate-run utopia for the super-rich, and a hellhole for all the rest.

Catherine 'Cat' Leblanc is an orphan that is about as far from super-rich as one can be. When the Incursion alarms start blaring and the sky starts raining hungry xenos, it's just another blemish on an already piss-poor afternoon.


A cyberpunk magical-girl alien-invasion LitRPG.

It's exactly as wild as it sounds.
