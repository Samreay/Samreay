## Blurb

**Lucas used to delve dungeons. Now, he has to run one.**

After Lucas dies during a freak explosion, divine intervention sees him brought back to life with the power to control a new dungeon.

Thereâ€™s just a couple of issues: his old body is bound to his dungeon, and the craziness of what he thought was his final act is only getting weirder. When he sees newbie adventures entering his dungeon, though, he decides to help them survive and complete their quests. 

After all, adventuring is a process, and someone needs to guide the rookies.

## Thoughts

*As of writing this review, I've read the first published book.*



Good things: scratches the mmo nostalgia without being a vrmmo book. lots of potential for skill shenanigans later one (but not as much initially due to slower pacing)

bad: gets a bit repetivie with the same groups running the same dungeon with minor tweaks. compare to divine dungeon, where the MC gets has the mining, economics, ecosystem creation, goblins, etc, theres a lot more than can be done
my possible lack of understanding of the macro plot made the conflict feel forced
personal gripe: not all litrpg has to be isekai. hwfwm is a good example of how it can  be done well, because earth integration. but for books like this, unbound, etc, with the MCs prior life has absolutely no impact on the story, all it does is serve as a way for authors to lazily descibribe things by comparing them to earth stuff. its good and easy, for sure, but i feel (in general), it really takes away from possible world building.
