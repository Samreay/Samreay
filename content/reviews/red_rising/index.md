## Blurb


Darrow is a Helldiver. A pioneer of Mars.

Born to slave beneath the earth so that one day, future generations might live above it.

He is a Red - humankind's lowest caste. But he has something the Golds - the ruthless ruling class - will never understand.

He has a wife he worships, a family who give him strength. He has love.

And when they take that from him, all that remains is revenge...

## Thoughts

*As of writing this, I've read the whole (initial) trilogy, but not the second as it's not yet finished.*

I asked reddit for some amazing cyberpunk stories to read, and Red Rising---despite *not even being cyberpunk*---was by far the most recommended story. Why? Because it's amazing. There are some progression fantasy aspects to it (school/tournament-like arc at the start, Darrow learning the ropes and coming into his own, etc), but that's not the focus of the story. The story is larger than Darrow. Larger than his family. Larger than his friends. It's a story of the human race, oppression, and the agonising fight for freedom.

But let me be specific. Very minor generalist early-book-one spoilers.

Darrow was born a Red. His people are enslaved, kept in ignorance of the reality of both Mars and the solar system itself. The low colours living on the surface are just as trapped, and even the Silvers are merely servants to the Golden rulers. And thus the great plan - can Darrow, masquerading as a Gold, ascend through their ranks? Can he play their game well and claim enough power to help his own people break their chains?

For those who want an indominable protagonist, this book is for you. Darrow is passionate, arrogant, and filled with rage. With each setback, he finds a picks himself up and finds a new path forward. And make no mistake - Darrow faces so many setbacks. Everything that can goes wrong does go wrong, every single time. Betrayal, alliances, and loyalty are strong themes in the work, and I'll admit that you eventually get to the point where any time a character is introduced you try and guess how many chapters it'll take before they try and stab someone (normally Darrow) in the back.

But, hey, that's exactly what the author was aiming for with the world they painted, so... good work?

The plotlines of this book put most things I've read in the past year to shame, but the price it costs is that this work is heavy. By the time I finished the third book, my brain was tapping out. "Enough pain," it yelled at me. "Go and read something bright and happy and maybe with some sentient farm animals."

I suspect it may not be enough. I think this book will linger on my mind for weeks.
