## Blurb

By a stroke of fate, a stone gains sentience and sets out on a grand quest to touch grass. 

However, the system forgot to change its stats from their \[Metric\] values to the appropriate [Str, Int, Dex] values.

Things escalate. Fast. 

Features:
- Cultivation 
- Jade Beauties
- Numbers go up (Ridiculously up. All of them)
- Most balanced protagonist of all time (is round, so is balanced)

## Thoughts

As you might have guessed, I've read quite a few LitRPG, cutivation, and PF series. Sometimes I need a break from the seriousness, from the cookie-cutter self-insert template MC to do something a bit different. I suppose I'm not the only one feeling this, given the recent surge in non-human MCs. Roomba, half-eaten-apple-core, demonic tree, and now, above all of them (on a mountain), a rolling stone.

It's great. The parody is *on point*, and there are tropes taken from so many different genres and specific published works that I read through most of the story with a small smile on my face.

The main quest the rolling stone gets is to make it to the bottom of the mountain. There's a nice twist that happens to keep things fresh before the quest is completed, and it's also great.

Look, the plot is simple---the book is a parody---so I can't give details without spoiling the whole thing.

It's short (literally an hour or two to read it), it's well written and downright hilarious in some parts, so if you like any form of witty poking fun of genres and stereotypes, just read it.
