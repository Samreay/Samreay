*As of the time of writing this review, I've read about three books worth of content and plan to read much more.*

## Blurb

The life of an Infant Demon is a bloody grind to the top. For Salvos, a curious newborn Demon with a penchant for making friends, surviving the swarms of wild Demons in the Netherworld was always going to be a difficult task. She will adapt, gain experience, and evolve to survive this hellish landscape with the help of her sole companion.

But when her companion's life is threatened by a mysterious Demon King, she'll have to do what it takes to save him. Even if it means separating from him and being tossed into an unfamiliar world with Humans, monsters, and a bright blue sky where she is scorned for being born a Demon.

However, the law of evolution is survival of the fittest, and no matter where she is, Salvos will survive.

## Thoughts

I was initially apprehensive to dive into Salvos. The story is approaching *five thousand* pages, and I have a bad habit of being swept up by a good story and then getting literally nothing done until I finish it. It happened, and I'm here writing this review after only a few books to try and mentally allow myself to stop reading so I can get something else done in my life.

Dammit Melas.

Now, you might know the author more for his rampant shitposting on the /r/ProgressionFantasy sub, or perhaps one of his many other fictions, but I'll keep content here about Salvos. So let's talk plot without spoilers.

It's nice to follow a protagonist that isn't a blank slate MC. Even better, the MC isn't even human, and it provides a nice change in perspectives and attitudes from many other serials. Our MC, Salvos, is a demon. The story follows literally from her laval form, through her numerous evolutions and class ups. As the blurb says, Salvos is thrown into the human world (though humans are one of many species) early on, and retruning to her companion is a central point to the overarching plot. 

It's *not* obviously the onle thing going on, and mostly that plot point sits in the background as a problem almost without solution, and Salvos needs to keep searching and growing stronger to achieve her goal.

She does this with a small cast of friends. Daniel, who would probably be the MC of a serial all by himself, is a great character with an amazing background. He fits the hero archetype, and the other main companion, Edithe, acts as a more serious character. Each of them *are* characters in their own right, and not just stereotypes come to life, or characters that exist only to highlight how amazing the MC is.

Back to the MC, Salvos carries the story. She's innocent and ignorant of the world, but is also a demon that doesn't necessarily elevate human life to being sacred. And when you scratch the surface, the author peels back the vineer of selfishness to reveal a nuanced character with complexity. Salvos has layers, like an onion. She is, however, not green.

Throughout books and chapters, the world is gradually revealed as larger and more complex than ever before, with the trio journeying from their tutorial-like starting location to increasingly exotic and dangerous lands. They meet new races and species, and you get insight into their different cultures and traditions. It's very nicely done, and I can see why so many people follow the story.

If I had to search for a downside, it's that I don't have enough time to read it all. Melas, you write too quickly, and I have too little free time. Show some damn mercy!
