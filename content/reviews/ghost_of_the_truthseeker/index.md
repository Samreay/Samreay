## Blurb

**Earth is initiated, and Alistair finds himself in a dangerous new world…**

On a day like any other, an alien descends to Earth, unleashing untold death and destruction.

Alistair watches the live news footage of the carnage, his eyes glued to the image of impossible power made manifest.

The alien’s arrival kicks events into motion that no one could have predicted. Earth is prematurely initiated into a universe-spanning empire of cut-throat cultivators, beasts, and entities of ungodly power – all guided by a mysterious AI System.

The System’s first quest? Kill someone.

Amidst the chaos, Alistair must make a choice. Will he fight for the sake of power, or stand against the forces of evil?

His decision will alter the threads of destiny.

Separated from his family and friends, Alistair must find his way through a new world where power is obtained through conflict – and cultivation leads to the insurmountable Peak.

Whatever it takes, he will secure his own path to eternity.

Dive into a cultivation story with LitRPG apocalypse elements, including classes, skills, monster waves, and a progression system full of secrets and possibilities. Perfect for fans of Defiance of the Fall and The Primal Hunter!

## Thoughts

*As of writing this review, I've read the first published book on KU.*

Good: levelling and dao is impactful and creates vastly different combat systels for other characters
peeve: exposition and telling rather than showing
peeve: pov and information breaking
peeve: random tp arc was very web serial and i was frustrated because I wanted to see the earth arc finish. it all tied together, so keep that in mind if you think "dammit why are we starting something new", dont worry, it loops back in
