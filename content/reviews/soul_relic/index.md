> **Born with an enormous well of power but no way to regenerate it, Raysha will risk anything to fix herself, even if it means venturing into the unknown with nothing but her brother, an enchanted water bottle, and a stubborn attitude.**


> Without the ability to cultivate aeon from the world, Raysha has been treated like an outcast her whole life. While she has to ration her power drop-by-drop, others use it as commonly as breathing. In a world where true masters of aeon have slaughtered gods, Raysha's future in her village is limited to babysitting pre-awakened children who inevitably surpass and mock her.


> So when her brother visits from the Academy with a dangerous new idea to help her, Raysha jumps at the chance to finally do something. Her brother believes that with three simple things, they might have a cure: an enchanted water bottle, a simple change of scenery, and—-of course-the crystalized heart of an ancient spirit. Raysha is skeptical, but with her refreshing drink in hand, the pair head out into the wider world in search of the impossible.


**Read if you like:**

* A strong female lead
* Genuine and positive sibling bonds

* Discrete stages of advancement

**Other things:**

* No harem and no sexual abuse

Additionally, the amazing John Bierce, author of Mage Errant, was one of my beta readers, and now I unleash his testimonial:

> If you're looking for something new to read, you should give Samuel Hinton's *Soul Relic* a look! It's got an intricate magic system that's going to be a blast to theory-build with, high-octane fight scenes set in awesome locales, and characters you'll find immediately likeable. *Soul Relic* is absolutely worth checking out.

And if that hasn't convinced you, just look at how nice the cover art is. Massive props to [Mansik Yang](https://www.artstation.com/yam8417) for his hard work and talent.
