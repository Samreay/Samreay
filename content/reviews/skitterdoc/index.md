## Blurb

A crossover between Worm and the Cyberpunk universe. Takes place in Night City. MC is Taylor from an AU (Triggers with Alt Power, Bonesaw's power), but she lived her life as is canon, then gets swapped into the Cyberpunk universe and must survive. Medical Tinker Taylor in a Cyberpunk world.

## Thoughts

*As of writing (October 2024) I've ready all published chatpers. The last one was from months ago though, so I hope the author picks the story back up soon.*

Skitterdoc 2077 is a meandering, pseudo-slice-of-life cyberpunk story. Well, as much as any story set in Night City and a corpo controlled world can truly be slice-of-life. 99% of the story follows the Taylor in cyberpunk world, with only a few chapters here and there showing what the OG cyberpunk Taylor (now in Worm's world) is up to.

The MC's power is, for those (like me) who haven't read Worm, are effectively complete knowledge of medical things (like genetics, etc) and a Tinker power which allows her to skirt the laws of physics when creating or inventing things which intersect with her newfound knowledge. This makes Taylor effectively the worlds best doctor, ripperdoc, genetics researcher, and bioweapon innovator. Not that she does too much of the latter, of course.

Apart from those powers, there aren't other LitRPG elements, and progression takes place mostly in Taylor learning about the world, augmenting herself, and then [redacted]. It's slow, and the focus is much more on her personal journey into becoming a member of Night City. There are a number of distinct arcs, include those that take you outside Night City, and even some time in space, though I wouldn't describe the space stuff as an arc, though maybe one day in the future the plotlines that lead offworld become enough for the author to spend a chunk of time writing about it.

For those wanting a more casual and laid-back journey through a cyberpunk world, this would be a great read. If, however, you're searching for a cunning MC that grabs power at every opportunity, this isn't for you. Taylor has a lot of advantages, but often chooses not to use them to their full ability to get ahead. Her goal isn't to make Adam Smasher her bitch, it's to figure out biological immortality and live a long, happy, and safe life despite the world being, you know, shit.

There are a huge number of open plotlines right now, and I feel like if the author came back and dropped a hundred chapters maybe some of them would tie back together, but it's hard to speculate. I'm sad it ended right (or moreso has gone on hiatus) right as global tensions are escalating. If someone can send me a message when/if the series continues (I don't check forum based sites like SB/SV often) that'd be great, because I really want to see how the next 10 chapters unfold.
