Presenting, some desert caves, cave system, lava basin, dubiously engineered bridges, and small
encampment! The idea for this one was after climbing down the hole in [the previous map](/blog/2017/09/16/map-camp.html)
you would end up in the top right corner of this map.

Once again, following the style of Mark Bowen's maps over at [Blue Sword Games](https://www.patreon.com/blueswordgames).


So, for this map, here are the outlines and grid versions:

And because the lava is very visually strong, if you want the play area to be more 
of the focus than the lava, use this image:

For a better print version without mass shadows, try this:

For a map without the bridges, try this:
