It turns out when you throw three comedians together on stage its super hard to keep 
up with the banter! I was the guest scientist invite on the amazing 
[Probably Science](http://www.probablyscience.com/) podcast.

The episode [should be live right now](http://www.probablyscience.com/probablyscience/2019/3/6/episode-330-live-from-brisbane-with-liz-miele-and-samuel-hinton), 
so give it a listen, especially if
you have a love for koalas.
