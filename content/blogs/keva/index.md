Seeing KEVA simulations always makes my day brighter, so I thought I'd make a small one myself. This one
has a series of very light wood blocks set on top some very heavy metal blocks as the base. Two steel balls
are shot at the structure, and if you watch the video you can probably guess which of them is solid 
and which is simply a thin shell over a hollow interior!
