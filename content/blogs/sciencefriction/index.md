During the early days of the COVID-19 outburst I was recruited into the COVID-19 Critical Care Consortium
(then called ECMOCARD) as the lead data analyst, responsible for setting up a data reduction and cleaning pipeline
for the consortium, in addition to producing reports, graphs and dashboards for clinical staff and consortium members.

I had a chat with Natasha Mitchell about how this all came about, its relations to astronomy and more in an
episode of Science Friction.
