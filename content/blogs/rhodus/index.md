The continent of Rhodus is the main setting for my work *Soul Relic*.

The story begins in Hayet village in the nation of Darius, which you can find in the lower-left
corner of the map. This is still a work in progress, and I might tweak or change things as times go on.

The resolution is quite high, so feel free to zoom in if you have the touchscreen for it. If you don't, feel free to save the image and zoom to your heart's content.
