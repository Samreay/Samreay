With the Keva simulation I made, all the blocks are spaced out with room to move. I was 
curious to see how Blender's engine would cope when the blocks were tightly packed, so,
surprise surprise, I made a group of tightly packed cubes and then threw a glass sphere at them.

I randomised the materials of the cubes to add some spice, and fiddled around with simulation
speed to get a slow motion section of the simulation. Enjoy!
