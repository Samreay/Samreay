\section{Experience}

\begin{entrylist}
\entry
{2020-Now}
{University of Queensland}
{Brisbane, Queensland, Australia}
{\emph{Postdoctoral Researcher} \\
Continued research using Hierarchical Bayesian modelling to perform supernova cosmology. Created data pipelines and high-fidelity numerical simulations to quantify methodologies. Implemented machine learning classifiers to discriminate between supernova types. Applied model selection techniques to models of large-scale-structure in the universe.}
\entry
{2019-Now}
{SuperDataScience}
{Sunshine Coast, Queensland, Australia}
{\emph{Course Instructor} \\
Created courses on statistical analysis and data manipulation in Python for students. Focused on applied statistics and utilisation of modern code packages, with attention given to visual output and workflows for continuous validation of methodology.}
\entry
{2017, 2016}
{Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory}
{Berkeley, California}
{\emph{Research Fellowship} \\
	Research fellowship to work on Bayesian Hierarchical Modelling and its applications to Supernova Cosmology. Specifically, investigating how to use high dimensional hierarchical models to model individual supernova instead of populations to provide better constraints on cosmology using supernova discovered by the Dark Energy Survey. Involved using numerous MCMC fitters, Stan, Gaussian processes and many numerical techniques.}


\entry
{2015--2016}
{Gemini \& Australian Astronomical Observatory}
{La Serena, Chile}
{\emph{Research Intern} \\
Utilised photometric data of a nearby galaxy to determine globular cluster candidates and their properties. Utilised and created data reduction pipelines, automated analysis methods, and applied machine learning techniques to perform object classification.}

\entry
{2010--2014}
{GBST}
{Brisbane, Queensland, Australia}
{\emph{Software Developer} \\
Developed business intelligence reporting solutions, designing and developing server and client based web application code, creation of large scale SQL queries. Optimised queries, databases, and applications for network, processing, and memory constraints, developed back-end server code and front-end web applications, plus API's to connect the two.}
