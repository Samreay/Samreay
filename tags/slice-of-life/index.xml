Clarke's 'Mark of the Fool'</title><link>https://cosmiccoding.com.au/reviews/mark_of_the_fool/</link><pubDate>Fri, 30 Sep 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://cosmiccoding.com.au/reviews/mark_of_the_fool/</guid><description>As of writing this review, I have read the KU release and up to chapter 200, which is about half-way through the available chapters.
So here&amp;rsquo;s the premise: Alex Roth is one of five chosen Heroes that need to defeat a reoccurring villain: The Ravener. Alex, however, is the Fool. His Mark, instead of making him a combat savant, powerful spellcaster, etc, makes him really great at learning things that are outside of combat and spellcasting&amp;hellip; but will actively interfere with his abilities if they are not.</description></item><item><title>A Review of CasualFarmer's Cultivation novel 'Beware of Chicken'</title><link>https://cosmiccoding.com.au/reviews/beware_of_chicken/</link><pubDate>Sun, 01 May 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://cosmiccoding.com.au/reviews/beware_of_chicken/</guid><description>As of writing this review, I have read all 212 published chapters on Royal Road.
I saw this series recommended a few times on various groups and subreddits, but I always put it off because the name of the series didn&amp;rsquo;t exactly give me details about what it was about. The tidal wave of support for the work pushed me over the edge, so I picked it up&amp;hellip; and it turns out that was a great decision.</description></item><item><title>A review of J.L. Mullins' 'Millenium Mage'</title><link>https://cosmiccoding.com.au/reviews/millenium_mage/</link><pubDate>Wed, 11 Jan 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://cosmiccoding.com.au/reviews/millenium_mage/</guid><description>As of writing this review, I&amp;rsquo;ve read all 224 published chapters.
Blurb The world is wild, untamed. Humanity thrives, but only in isolated, well defended cities, ever shrinking as the wilds slowly reclaim all that was taken. The most capable magic users are raised up as Mages to serve mankind, further their cause, and defend them over the course of millennia.
Tala is freshly graduated from the magic academy and determined to make her own way in the world.</description></item><item><title>A Review of Yrsillar's Forge of Destiny</title><link>https://cosmiccoding.com.au/reviews/forge_of_destiny/</link><pubDate>Wed, 26 May 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://cosmiccoding.com.au/reviews/forge_of_destiny/</guid><description>Forge of Destiny starts like many cultivation novels. Plucky young girl from the streets, Ling Qi, has the talent and joins the Sect of Argent Peak. She then struggles to rise up in the inner rankings of the Sect. It has your normal progression systems, spiritual pills, removing impurities, it has moves and techniques, a vide cast of characters, but at the end of the day I wasn&amp;rsquo;t drawn in.</description></item><item><title>Tao Wong's A Thousand Li - classical cultivation doled out sparingly</title><link>https://cosmiccoding.com.au/reviews/thousand_li/</link><pubDate>Tue, 01 Jun 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://cosmiccoding.com.au/reviews/thousand_li/</guid><description>Disclaimer: Due to Tao Wong filing infringement notices against LitRPG authors for using &amp;ldquo;System&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;Apocalypse&amp;rdquo;, I&amp;rsquo;m not continuing with this series. There are plenty of authors who add positively to this community that I can support instead of someone who tries to tear it down.
I had heard great things about this series, and A Thousand Li is a staple on the cultivation and progression fantasy reading lists. So take this review with a grain of salt, that obviously my take here may not be reflective of the wider community.</description></item></channel></rss>
