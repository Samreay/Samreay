Blurb Elaine is ripped from this world to Pallos, a land of unlimited possibilities made real by a grand System governing classes, skills, and magic.
An ideal society? What is this, a fantasy novel?
Adventures? Right this way!
A Grand quest? Nah.
Friends and loot? Heck yes!
Humans are the top dog?</description></item><item><title>A review of Sarah Lin's 'The Weirkey Chronicles'</title><link>https://cosmiccoding.com.au/reviews/weirkey/</link><pubDate>Wed, 17 Aug 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://cosmiccoding.com.au/reviews/weirkey/</guid><description>As of writing this, I have read all five released books, and will be picking up the next whenever it comes out!
Our MC, Theo, has spent decades searching for a way back into the magical realms of the Nine Worlds. After a bitter life with no success, he eventually finds his way back, only to confront the fact that the ideals of his younger self are only a distant memory to the man he now is.</description></item><item><title>A review of J.R.

After tragically losing the only person he ever cared about, Alexander, a rogue artificial intelligence, opens a portal to an alternate dimension to escape his grief.
Scanning trillions of different dimensions, Alexander finally finds a world that is reminiscent of the only time he was ever happy, back when he could play virtual reality games with his only friend. He doesn&amp;rsquo;t know why, or how, such a world exists, but he doesn&amp;rsquo;t care.</description></item><item><title>A review of Rhaegar's 'Azarinth Healer'</title><link>https://cosmiccoding.com.au/reviews/azarinth_healer/</link><pubDate>Sun, 04 Dec 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://cosmiccoding.com.au/reviews/azarinth_healer/</guid><description>Blurb Ilea likes punching things. And eating.
Unfortunately, there arenâ€™t too many career options for hungry brawlers. Instead, the plan is to quit her crappy fast-food job, go to college, and become a fully functioning member of society. Essentially - a fate worse than death.
So maybe it&amp;rsquo;s lucky that she wakes up one day in a strange world where a bunch of fantasy monsters are trying to kill her&amp;hellip;?</description></item><item><title>A review of RavensDagger's 'Cinnamon Bun'</title><link>https://cosmiccoding.com.au/reviews/cinnamon_bun/</link><pubDate>Fri, 23 Sep 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://cosmiccoding.com.au/reviews/cinnamon_bun/</guid><description>As readers of this genre know, LitRPG worlds can be a depressing, harrowing, and cut-throat place. Half of the MC&amp;rsquo;s I&amp;rsquo;ve read in other works get ahead because this suits them just fine. They&amp;rsquo;re happy to fight, happy to get their hands dirty, happy to shake the system up. In many ways, that&amp;rsquo;s part of the escapism. Having power.
Cinnamon Bun has a slightly different take. The world is less apocalyptic in fashion, and our main character, Broccoli Bunch, just wants to go on cool adventures and make friends.</description></item><item><title>A Review of Dakota Krout's Completionist Chronicles and Ritualist from a grumpy LitRPG reader</title><link>https://cosmiccoding.com.au/reviews/completionist_chronicles/</link><pubDate>Mon, 03 May 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://cosmiccoding.com.au/reviews/completionist_chronicles/</guid><description>Completionist Chronicles is set in the same universe as Divine Dungeon. Or more so, it&amp;rsquo;s set inside the Dungeon, with a weird tie into modern-day Earth. I&amp;rsquo;ll focus this write-up on the first book, Ritualist.
Let&amp;rsquo;s get that out of the way - the book has a weird opening. It&amp;rsquo;s the end of the world, and President Elon [Musk] encourages everyone to start a new life in a new world before vanishing into thin air (transported into the dungeon&amp;rsquo;s constructed LitRPG world).</description></item><item><title>A Review of Avitue's 'And (N)one Shall Remain'</title><link>https://cosmiccoding.com.au/reviews/and_none_shall_remain/</link><pubDate>Fri, 10 Feb 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://cosmiccoding.com.au/reviews/and_none_shall_remain/</guid><description>As of the time of writing this review, I have read the available chapters (chapter 40).
Blurb Two Lives, Two Souls, Both forced down into their roles,
One in the Light, One in the Dark, As the Fates portend,
One to uphold, one to turn over the Mores,
Would they Save the World, or Bring it to its End?
A story where things might not be what they seem like.</description></item><item><title>A Review of Jamie Kojola's 'Odyssey of the Ethereal'</title><link>https://cosmiccoding.com.au/reviews/odyssey_of_the_ethereal/</link><pubDate>Thu, 09 Feb 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://cosmiccoding.com.au/reviews/odyssey_of_the_ethereal/</guid><description>As of the time of writing this review, I have read the available chapters (chapter 31).
Blurb Aesca Lampi was a skilled MMO player and raid leader, but she never could have predicted the turn her life would take when she died and was reborn as Aetheria, a chosen hero tasked with overthrowing the Goddess of Misery and bringing hope to the suffering world of Grief. Armed with the power of regeneration and a fierce determination, Aetheria sets out to climb the Ten Towers and fulfill her destiny.</description></item><item><title>A review of KamikazePotato's 'An Outcast In Another World'</title><link>https://cosmiccoding.com.au/reviews/outcast_in_another_world/</link><pubDate>Thu, 04 Aug 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://cosmiccoding.com.au/reviews/outcast_in_another_world/</guid><description>This review was written after I had read all three published books. I&amp;rsquo;m waiting on the Kindle version instead of reading on RR so I can give the author my money.
If you liked HWFWM, Defiance of the Fall, Primal Hunter, or Randidly, you&amp;rsquo;ll like this series.
Initially, I was worried when the starting chapters felt very close to both DoT and Primal Hunter. Young white man in a forest with dangerous beasts&amp;hellip; I&amp;rsquo;ve read that few too many times for it to still hold the magic it originally held with me.</description></item><item><title>A Review of Jame A. Hunter's Rogue Dungeon. Light-hearted fun.</title><link>https://cosmiccoding.com.au/reviews/rogue_dungeon/</link><pubDate>Sun, 09 Jan 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://cosmiccoding.com.au/reviews/rogue_dungeon/</guid><description>Review based on reading the first three books: Rogue Dungeon, Civil War, and Troll Nation.
Roark von Graf lives in a fantasy world, trying to overthrow a tyrant. By weird magic, he is teleported into an Earth video game into a troll&amp;rsquo;s body, and his goal is to get back to his world with enough power to overthrow the tyrant.
It&amp;rsquo;s a weird premise, having the MC not be a normal Earthman, but still having them inhabit an Earth video game where player characters are regular people.</description></item><item><title>A Review of Shirtaloon's He Who Fights With Monsters, a great LitRPG with an opinionated protagonist.</title><link>https://cosmiccoding.com.au/reviews/hwfwm/</link><pubDate>Tue, 02 Mar 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://cosmiccoding.com.au/reviews/hwfwm/</guid><description>Jason, our MC, is simultaneously this series greatest strengths and greatest weakness.
Transported to a magical world, Jason is thrown into some truly unfortunate circumstances right off the bat. Weirdly there&amp;rsquo;s very little detail given about Jason and his past life, apart from a few vague comments about it not exactly being ideal (I mean, he was Australian, just like me, so points for that), but there&amp;rsquo;s no time to dwell on that as Jason struggles to survive against a host of organisations, beasts, and eventually eldritch horrors.</description></item><item><title>A review of Benjamin Kerei's 'Oh Great! I was Reincarnated as a Farmer'</title><link>https://cosmiccoding.com.au/reviews/reincarnated_as_a_farmer/</link><pubDate>Mon, 04 Jul 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://cosmiccoding.com.au/reviews/reincarnated_as_a_farmer/</guid><description>I&amp;rsquo;m writing this review after reading book one, I&amp;rsquo;ll grab book two once it&amp;rsquo;s out and update this page.
The premise of the book is fairly simple. Through some unfortunate accident, the MC (Arnold) is taken from Earth and his job as a semi-pro gamer, and reincarnated in the body of a farmer. The world has levels and a class based system (without it being a &amp;lsquo;capital S&amp;rsquo; system), and classes can&amp;rsquo;t be changed.</description></item><item><title>A physicist reviews Dominic Stal's 'The Last Physicist'</title><link>https://cosmiccoding.com.au/reviews/last_physicist/</link><pubDate>Sun, 05 Jun 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://cosmiccoding.com.au/reviews/last_physicist/</guid><description>For those coming here from reddit or similar, I&amp;rsquo;ll come clean. I had high expectations for this book. As a physicist myself, a book about a physicist using the scientific method to put some hard rules to magic and delve into the mechanics had me almost giddy with excitement. So I dove into this book, and, I&amp;rsquo;ll be frank, came away disappointed.
The book follows the MC, Will. In another fun coincidence, Will works at Fermilab in Chicago.</description></item><item><title>A review of Samer Rabadi's 'Eight'</title><link>https://cosmiccoding.com.au/reviews/eight/</link><pubDate>Tue, 22 Nov 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://cosmiccoding.com.au/reviews/eight/</guid><description>Blurb Lifeâ€™s tough when youâ€™re trapped in an eight-year-old body on another world.
His name is Eight. Not really, but thatâ€™s what the System decided after a slip of the tongue. One moment, he was stepping out the office door on the way home, and the next waking up on a hillside below a town wall. Oh, and the gate guard drove him off, because he thought Eight was a monster.</description></item><item><title>A Review of Aleron Kong's Chaos Seeds Series: A tale of the luckiest man in the world</title><link>https://cosmiccoding.com.au/reviews/chaos_seeds/</link><pubDate>Fri, 12 Feb 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://cosmiccoding.com.au/reviews/chaos_seeds/</guid><description>Is the Chaos Seeds series a fun read?
For sure.
Is it sensible? Is it serious? Is it consistent?
No.
If you don&amp;rsquo;t care about that and just want a light-hearted, fun read, maybe this series is for you.
Me, I thought that I don&amp;rsquo;t need anything series. Damn, I finished Malazan and I need a multi-year palate cleanser to get over the cauldron of tragedy in that series. However, I almost put down this series a few times.</description></item><item><title>A Review of Andries Louws' The Dao of Magic. A strange blend of pop references and ridiculously overpowered protagonists</title><link>https://cosmiccoding.com.au/reviews/dao_magic/</link><pubDate>Wed, 24 Nov 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://cosmiccoding.com.au/reviews/dao_magic/</guid><description>I link to the Amazon publication, however, I read the Royal Road version. If there have been future substantial changes to the series since I read it, this review may not be accurate.
Drew, originally from Earth, has spent a thousand years or so cultivating on another world. He goes to ascend, but, oh no, something goes wrong, and he is send to a different world instead, to start from scratch.</description></item></channel></rss>
