Officially my favourite LitRPG.</title><link>https://cosmiccoding.com.au/reviews/dungeon_crawler_carl/</link><pubDate>Mon, 10 Jan 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://cosmiccoding.com.au/reviews/dungeon_crawler_carl/</guid><description>Dungeon Crawler Carl opens with something reminiscent of Hitchhiker&amp;rsquo;s Guide to the Galaxy. Earth is being mined for minerals, and those that survived the initial population purge become participants in the universe&amp;rsquo;s most popular show, as they progress through a deadly dungeon run by an insane AI to either try and survive or beat the dungeon and win back their planet.
Now that is a fun premise.
Carl enters the dungeon with Princess Donut, a prize-winning cat.</description></item><item><title>A Review of Selkie Myth's series 'Beneath the Dragoneye Moons'</title><link>https://cosmiccoding.com.au/reviews/beneath_the_dragons_eye_moons/</link><pubDate>Sun, 19 Feb 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://cosmiccoding.com.au/reviews/beneath_the_dragons_eye_moons/</guid><description>As of writing this review, I&amp;rsquo;ve read everything published, which is books one through to nine in the series.
Blurb Elaine is ripped from this world to Pallos, a land of unlimited possibilities made real by a grand System governing classes, skills, and magic.
An ideal society? What is this, a fantasy novel?
Adventures? Right this way!
A Grand quest? Nah.
Friends and loot? Heck yes!
Humans are the top dog?</description></item><item><title>A Review of J. R. Mathews's 'Jakes Magical Market', a fun LitRPG apocalypse romb with a card based system.</title><link>https://cosmiccoding.com.au/reviews/jakes_magical_market/</link><pubDate>Tue, 01 Mar 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://cosmiccoding.com.au/reviews/jakes_magical_market/</guid><description>Before I picked up this book, I must have seen Jake&amp;rsquo;s Magical Market recommended a dozen times on the /r/ProgressionFantasy subreddit. It even got a shoutout from Bryce O&amp;rsquo;Connor, and then, after about ten more people told me to read it, I pulled the trigger, added it to my Kindle, and then I read the entire thing&amp;mdash;all eight hundred pages&amp;mdash;in a single weekend.
So yeah, I thought it was pretty good.</description></item><item><title>A Review of Actus' 'My Best Friend is an Eldritch Horror.'</title><link>https://cosmiccoding.com.au/reviews/best_friend_eldritch_horror/</link><pubDate>Tue, 21 Feb 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://cosmiccoding.com.au/reviews/best_friend_eldritch_horror/</guid><description>As of writing this review, I&amp;rsquo;ve read all three published books in the series.
Blurb Damien nearly ended the world. Now, his mistake might be the only thing that can save it.
Good things come to those who wait. Damien Vale didnâ€™t, and he ended up bound to an Eldritch creature from beyond the reaches of space. It has lived since the dawn of time, seen the world born and destroyed countless times, and wants to be called Henry.</description></item><item><title>A Review of zechamp's 'DMG=MA: A Rolling Stone LitRPG'</title><link>https://cosmiccoding.com.au/reviews/rolling_stone/</link><pubDate>Tue, 07 Feb 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://cosmiccoding.com.au/reviews/rolling_stone/</guid><description>Blurb By a stroke of fate, a stone gains sentience and sets out on a grand quest to touch grass.
However, the system forgot to change its stats from their [Metric] values to the appropriate [Str, Int, Dex] values.
Things escalate. Fast.
Features:
Cultivation Jade Beauties Numbers go up (Ridiculously up. All of them) Most balanced protagonist of all time (is round, so is balanced) Thoughts As you might have guessed, I&amp;rsquo;ve read quite a few LitRPG, cutivation, and PF series.</description></item><item><title>A review of RavensDagger's 'Cinnamon Bun'</title><link>https://cosmiccoding.com.au/reviews/cinnamon_bun/</link><pubDate>Fri, 23 Sep 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://cosmiccoding.com.au/reviews/cinnamon_bun/</guid><description>As readers of this genre know, LitRPG worlds can be a depressing, harrowing, and cut-throat place. Half of the MC&amp;rsquo;s I&amp;rsquo;ve read in other works get ahead because this suits them just fine. They&amp;rsquo;re happy to fight, happy to get their hands dirty, happy to shake the system up. In many ways, that&amp;rsquo;s part of the escapism. Having power.
Cinnamon Bun has a slightly different take. The world is less apocalyptic in fashion, and our main character, Broccoli Bunch, just wants to go on cool adventures and make friends.</description></item><item><title>A Review of Andrew Rowes's How to Defeat a Demon King in Ten Easy Steps. Hilarious love letter to Zelda.</title><link>https://cosmiccoding.com.au/reviews/how_to_defeat_a_demon_king_in_ten_easy_steps/</link><pubDate>Wed, 12 Jan 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://cosmiccoding.com.au/reviews/how_to_defeat_a_demon_king_in_ten_easy_steps/</guid><description>Let&amp;rsquo;s preface this real quick: this book is a short and fun read. It is not a sweeping fantasy series, it is not a classic zero-to-hero progression fantasy. It is a love letter to Zelda and other games, making fun of many video game tropes by highlighting just how ridiculous and obvious many are.
The main character finds a way to inventively use their class (A Bag Mage) to break various game systems.</description></item><item><title>A Review of Dakota Krout's Completionist Chronicles and Ritualist from a grumpy LitRPG reader</title><link>https://cosmiccoding.com.au/reviews/completionist_chronicles/</link><pubDate>Mon, 03 May 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://cosmiccoding.com.au/reviews/completionist_chronicles/</guid><description>Completionist Chronicles is set in the same universe as Divine Dungeon. Or more so, it&amp;rsquo;s set inside the Dungeon, with a weird tie into modern-day Earth. I&amp;rsquo;ll focus this write-up on the first book, Ritualist.
Let&amp;rsquo;s get that out of the way - the book has a weird opening. It&amp;rsquo;s the end of the world, and President Elon [Musk] encourages everyone to start a new life in a new world before vanishing into thin air (transported into the dungeon&amp;rsquo;s constructed LitRPG world).</description></item><item><title>A Review of Avitue's 'And (N)one Shall Remain'</title><link>https://cosmiccoding.com.au/reviews/and_none_shall_remain/</link><pubDate>Fri, 10 Feb 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://cosmiccoding.com.au/reviews/and_none_shall_remain/</guid><description>As of the time of writing this review, I have read the available chapters (chapter 40).
Blurb Two Lives, Two Souls, Both forced down into their roles,
One in the Light, One in the Dark, As the Fates portend,
One to uphold, one to turn over the Mores,
Would they Save the World, or Bring it to its End?
A story where things might not be what they seem like.</description></item><item><title>A Review of Honour Rae's 'All The Skills'</title><link>https://cosmiccoding.com.au/reviews/all_the_skills/</link><pubDate>Thu, 09 Feb 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://cosmiccoding.com.au/reviews/all_the_skills/</guid><description>As of the time of writing this review, I have read the available chapters (chapter 30 in book two or so).
Blurb The most Arthur could hope for was to someday earn a trash-tier spell card. When fate grants him a Master of Skills card, he&amp;rsquo;s thrust into a world of opportunity and danger.
To survive and grow strong, Arthur must learn skills. All the skills.
Thoughts Damn, that blurb is light, isn&amp;rsquo;t it?</description></item><item><title>A Review of Jamie Kojola's 'Odyssey of the Ethereal'</title><link>https://cosmiccoding.com.au/reviews/odyssey_of_the_ethereal/</link><pubDate>Thu, 09 Feb 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://cosmiccoding.com.au/reviews/odyssey_of_the_ethereal/</guid><description>As of the time of writing this review, I have read the available chapters (chapter 31).
Blurb Aesca Lampi was a skilled MMO player and raid leader, but she never could have predicted the turn her life would take when she died and was reborn as Aetheria, a chosen hero tasked with overthrowing the Goddess of Misery and bringing hope to the suffering world of Grief. Armed with the power of regeneration and a fierce determination, Aetheria sets out to climb the Ten Towers and fulfill her destiny.</description></item><item><title>A review of KamikazePotato's 'An Outcast In Another World'</title><link>https://cosmiccoding.com.au/reviews/outcast_in_another_world/</link><pubDate>Thu, 04 Aug 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://cosmiccoding.com.au/reviews/outcast_in_another_world/</guid><description>This review was written after I had read all three published books. I&amp;rsquo;m waiting on the Kindle version instead of reading on RR so I can give the author my money.
If you liked HWFWM, Defiance of the Fall, Primal Hunter, or Randidly, you&amp;rsquo;ll like this series.
Initially, I was worried when the starting chapters felt very close to both DoT and Primal Hunter. Young white man in a forest with dangerous beasts&amp;hellip; I&amp;rsquo;ve read that few too many times for it to still hold the magic it originally held with me.</description></item><item><title>A review of K.T. Hanna's 'Somnia Online'</title><link>https://cosmiccoding.com.au/reviews/somnia/</link><pubDate>Thu, 23 Jun 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://cosmiccoding.com.au/reviews/somnia/</guid><description>I&amp;rsquo;m writing this review as of reading the first three books. I&amp;rsquo;ll update it when I finish the series at a later date.
Somnia Online follows the journey of Wren, her best friend Harlow, and their guild, Fable. The premise, at the start, is simple. Wren&amp;rsquo;s mother is the lead designer for a massive vrmmo game, which offers unparalleled immersive via a headset which reads your brainwaves. Except, of course, the game is really just a test bed for the development for the games AI and the headset technology, which is funded by the military.</description></item><item><title>A Review of Noret Flood's 'The Legend of Randidly Ghosthound', a great take on system takeover LitRPG.</title><link>https://cosmiccoding.com.au/reviews/randidly_ghosthound/</link><pubDate>Fri, 28 Jan 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://cosmiccoding.com.au/reviews/randidly_ghosthound/</guid><description>Note: I&amp;rsquo;ve read the Amazon Book One, and then Royal Road chapters up to around Chapter 300 (ie many books worth). This review uses all of the content I&amp;rsquo;ve read, but I&amp;rsquo;ll make sure to separate book vs royal road if you&amp;rsquo;re thinking of buying. Actually, scrap that, just buy the first book, its great, and then continue on RR if you want.
So let&amp;rsquo;s begin with the basic premise. Earth is taken over by the System, and it becomes an effective post-apocalypse LitRPG adventure, which is fairly normal for the genre.</description></item><item><title>A Review of Dakota Krout's Divine Dungeon Series.</title><link>https://cosmiccoding.com.au/reviews/divine_dungeon/</link><pubDate>Wed, 03 Feb 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://cosmiccoding.com.au/reviews/divine_dungeon/</guid><description>This is another series I&amp;rsquo;ve read which I got instantly hooked on with a great premise, only to feel a bit let down at the conclusion many books later.
That said, I&amp;rsquo;ve read this series more than once, so it must be doing something right!
The Divine Dungeon series was my introduction to dungeon-core novels, and for that, I thank you, Dakota Krout. What this means is you follow the development of a sentient dungeon rather than a human character for most of the series.</description></item><item><title>A Review of Jame A. Hunter's Rogue Dungeon. Light-hearted fun.</title><link>https://cosmiccoding.com.au/reviews/rogue_dungeon/</link><pubDate>Sun, 09 Jan 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://cosmiccoding.com.au/reviews/rogue_dungeon/</guid><description>Review based on reading the first three books: Rogue Dungeon, Civil War, and Troll Nation.
Roark von Graf lives in a fantasy world, trying to overthrow a tyrant. By weird magic, he is teleported into an Earth video game into a troll&amp;rsquo;s body, and his goal is to get back to his world with enough power to overthrow the tyrant.
It&amp;rsquo;s a weird premise, having the MC not be a normal Earthman, but still having them inhabit an Earth video game where player characters are regular people.</description></item><item><title>A Review of Travis Bagwell's Awaken Online. A necromancer MC games the system as much as he can.</title><link>https://cosmiccoding.com.au/reviews/awaken_online/</link><pubDate>Sat, 04 Dec 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://cosmiccoding.com.au/reviews/awaken_online/</guid><description>Disclaimer: the thoughts in this review come from reading the first seven books of the series. The series is ongoing.
To kick things off, if you like overpowered main characters and don&amp;rsquo;t mind game systems or balances that blatantly favour the protagonist, you&amp;rsquo;ll enjoy this series a lot.
If you&amp;rsquo;re on the fence, I&amp;rsquo;d highly recommend reading at least the first book. It&amp;rsquo;s definitely the best of the ones that I&amp;rsquo;ve read so far.</description></item><item><title>A Review of Shirtaloon's He Who Fights With Monsters, a great LitRPG with an opinionated protagonist.</title><link>https://cosmiccoding.com.au/reviews/hwfwm/</link><pubDate>Tue, 02 Mar 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://cosmiccoding.com.au/reviews/hwfwm/</guid><description>Jason, our MC, is simultaneously this series greatest strengths and greatest weakness.
Transported to a magical world, Jason is thrown into some truly unfortunate circumstances right off the bat. Weirdly there&amp;rsquo;s very little detail given about Jason and his past life, apart from a few vague comments about it not exactly being ideal (I mean, he was Australian, just like me, so points for that), but there&amp;rsquo;s no time to dwell on that as Jason struggles to survive against a host of organisations, beasts, and eventually eldritch horrors.</description></item><item><title>A Review of Zogarth's LitRPG 'The Primal Hunter'</title><link>https://cosmiccoding.com.au/reviews/primal_hunter/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://cosmiccoding.com.au/reviews/primal_hunter/</guid><description>I&amp;rsquo;m just going to come out and say it. If you&amp;rsquo;ve read Defiance of the Fall and enjoyed it, you will love The Primal Hunter. It has a similar premise, similar (minimal) base-building and progression, but with better characters and less deus ex machina.
Now, to be fair, the author gets away with a lot on the social side of characterisation by making the main character incredibly anti-social, and then befriending a pair of (sentient) birds.</description></item><item><title>A review of Benjamin Kerei's 'Oh Great! I was Reincarnated as a Farmer'</title><link>https://cosmiccoding.com.au/reviews/reincarnated_as_a_farmer/</link><pubDate>Mon, 04 Jul 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://cosmiccoding.com.au/reviews/reincarnated_as_a_farmer/</guid><description>I&amp;rsquo;m writing this review after reading book one, I&amp;rsquo;ll grab book two once it&amp;rsquo;s out and update this page.
The premise of the book is fairly simple. Through some unfortunate accident, the MC (Arnold) is taken from Earth and his job as a semi-pro gamer, and reincarnated in the body of a farmer. The world has levels and a class based system (without it being a &amp;lsquo;capital S&amp;rsquo; system), and classes can&amp;rsquo;t be changed.</description></item><item><title>A Review of Andrew Seiple's Threadbare. Adorable, unique, and fascinating.</title><link>https://cosmiccoding.com.au/reviews/threadbare/</link><pubDate>Thu, 18 Nov 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://cosmiccoding.com.au/reviews/threadbare/</guid><description>This review focuses on the trilogy as a whole, not subsequent entries.
I will admit to some skepticism when I read the original premise - the main character is a stuffed bear.
But, in a fit of whimsy, I thought I&amp;rsquo;d give it a shot.
This was, as it turns out, a wonderful decision.
Threadbare follows the journey of the eponymous bear&amp;rsquo;s quest to try and find and save the daughter of his creator and his best friend - Cecelia Gearheart.</description></item><item><title>A Review of 'Defiance of the Fall', a system-apocalypse LitRPG / cultivation hybrid.</title><link>https://cosmiccoding.com.au/reviews/defiance_of_the_fall/</link><pubDate>Fri, 25 Mar 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://cosmiccoding.com.au/reviews/defiance_of_the_fall/</guid><description>As of the time of writing this review, I have read all four books on KU, and a further 200 chapters on RR, up to and including the time skip.
So Defiance of the Fall did hook me in, and the author is great at leaving each chapter with a teaser, cliffhanger, or something to get you thinking &amp;ldquo;Okay, just one more.&amp;rdquo; It had the same vibes as when I&amp;rsquo;m playing Civilisation, and it&amp;rsquo;s why I ended up reading several million words before I put the story down.</description></item><item><title>A physicist reviews Dominic Stal's 'The Last Physicist'</title><link>https://cosmiccoding.com.au/reviews/last_physicist/</link><pubDate>Sun, 05 Jun 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://cosmiccoding.com.au/reviews/last_physicist/</guid><description>For those coming here from reddit or similar, I&amp;rsquo;ll come clean. I had high expectations for this book. As a physicist myself, a book about a physicist using the scientific method to put some hard rules to magic and delve into the mechanics had me almost giddy with excitement. So I dove into this book, and, I&amp;rsquo;ll be frank, came away disappointed.
The book follows the MC, Will. In another fun coincidence, Will works at Fermilab in Chicago.</description></item><item><title>A Review of Chugong's Solo Levelling - an engaging take on the genre.</title><link>https://cosmiccoding.com.au/reviews/solo_levelling/</link><pubDate>Sat, 08 Jan 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://cosmiccoding.com.au/reviews/solo_levelling/</guid><description>Note: this review is based off the novel. I have heard the manhua doesn&amp;rsquo;t have many of the issues I&amp;rsquo;ve pointed out and recommend reading that instead.
Here&amp;rsquo;s the rough premise of Solo Levelling. The world was all normal, but now dungeon gates open, and teams of hunters have to enter, clear the dungeon and kill its boss. This will ensure the gates close. If they don&amp;rsquo;t close it in a week, the dungeon monsters can escape.</description></item><item><title>A Review of Aleron Kong's Chaos Seeds Series: A tale of the luckiest man in the world</title><link>https://cosmiccoding.com.au/reviews/chaos_seeds/</link><pubDate>Fri, 12 Feb 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://cosmiccoding.com.au/reviews/chaos_seeds/</guid><description>Is the Chaos Seeds series a fun read?
For sure.
Is it sensible? Is it serious? Is it consistent?
No.
If you don&amp;rsquo;t care about that and just want a light-hearted, fun read, maybe this series is for you.
Me, I thought that I don&amp;rsquo;t need anything series. Damn, I finished Malazan and I need a multi-year palate cleanser to get over the cauldron of tragedy in that series. However, I almost put down this series a few times.</description></item></channel></rss>
