Blurb The journey to the martial peak is a lonely, solitary and long one. In the face of adversity, you must survive and remain unyielding. Only then can you break through and continue on your journey to become the strongest. Sky Tower tests its disciples in the harshest ways to prepare them for this journey. One day the lowly sweeper Yang Kai managed to obtain a black book, setting him on the road to the peak of the martial world.</description></item><item><title>A Review of Chugong's Solo Levelling - an engaging take on the genre.</title><link>https://cosmiccoding.com.au/reviews/solo_levelling/</link><pubDate>Sat, 08 Jan 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://cosmiccoding.com.au/reviews/solo_levelling/</guid><description>Note: this review is based off the novel. I have heard the manhua doesn&amp;rsquo;t have many of the issues I&amp;rsquo;ve pointed out and recommend reading that instead.
Here&amp;rsquo;s the rough premise of Solo Levelling. The world was all normal, but now dungeon gates open, and teams of hunters have to enter, clear the dungeon and kill its boss. This will ensure the gates close. If they don&amp;rsquo;t close it in a week, the dungeon monsters can escape.</description></item></channel></rss>
