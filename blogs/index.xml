It rained a lot, enough some things got cancelled, but we still got some great pics.
From the sulphur vents and ponds&amp;hellip;
The hikes and bike rides&amp;hellip;
Went on a tree walk
We went on a luge. Yes, I won.
Visited the glow worms and some llamas.
And, of course, Hobbiton.</description></item><item><title>Scion of Storms Art</title><link>https://cosmiccoding.com.au/blogs/darian_nexus/</link><pubDate>Tue, 25 Oct 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://cosmiccoding.com.au/blogs/darian_nexus/</guid><description>I commissioned a settings piece from the amazing Richard Lay and I cannot stress how amazing it is.

Some websites claim to do it for you using AI, but you have to pay for access, and are they good? Others offer it as a service, but prices range from $10USD into the hundreds, so would an expensive animation be worth the investment? Is there any real difference in what you&amp;rsquo;d get?</description></item><item><title>Scion of Storms Prologue</title><link>https://cosmiccoding.com.au/blogs/scion_of_storms_prologue/</link><pubDate>Thu, 22 Sep 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://cosmiccoding.com.au/blogs/scion_of_storms_prologue/</guid><description>Manifestation, Book Two, is now in editing! To celebrate, I&amp;rsquo;m posting the prologue for all!
The Stormwall raged.
Lightning boomed from the black clouds above and thundered down into the gaping mouth of the maelstrom. An exposed claw of glass rising from the exposed seabed exploded as the strike connected.
Applicant Theolatos sat hidden on the floor of the ocean in a bubble of air held up solely by his will, undisturbed by the massive whirlpool only a stone&amp;rsquo;s throw away.</description></item><item><title>Lessons Learnt from Self Publishing</title><link>https://cosmiccoding.com.au/blogs/publishing_a_novel/</link><pubDate>Thu, 23 Jun 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://cosmiccoding.com.au/blogs/publishing_a_novel/</guid><description>While writing up Soul Relic, I reached out to a lot of authors for their advice in getting the novel off the ground.
Thanks to John Bierce, Bryce O&amp;rsquo;Connor, Phil Tucker, J.R. Mathews, Tobias Begley, Travis M. Riddle, and everyone I&amp;rsquo;ve also pestered on reddit.
Some of this is obvious, others not as much. Here&amp;rsquo;s a rough timeline of how I would go about things if I had to start over.</description></item><item><title>Christmas in Finland</title><link>https://cosmiccoding.com.au/blogs/finaland_2021/</link><pubDate>Tue, 21 Dec 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://cosmiccoding.com.au/blogs/finaland_2021/</guid><description>We had to relocate back to Australia so Kirrilee can pursue her studies at UQ. Instead of spending Christmas in the UK though, we appealed to Lydia and she was kind enough to let us stay with her for the break.
The view from her place is amazing. Dawn and sunset are so nice, plus the aurora at night.
We went rally car driving through an ice track. Kirrilee did much better than me, enough that she went straight into a snow drift.</description></item><item><title>Soul Relic Prologue</title><link>https://cosmiccoding.com.au/blogs/soul_relic_prologue/</link><pubDate>Sat, 06 Nov 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://cosmiccoding.com.au/blogs/soul_relic_prologue/</guid><description>Set on the continent of Rhodus, the Soul Relic series follows Raysha as she grapples with her broken soul and inability to effectively channel the spiritual force of aeon. In a world where those who advance in the spiritual arts enough are regarded as gods, living without this ability means living at the bottom of society.
Not a place Raysha wants to remain.

Given that country borders are still closed (and at this point we&amp;rsquo;re still waiting for a vaccine) the options were fairly limited. However, Scotland has been on both of our lists for a long time, so we decided to head up North and visit the Isle of Skye.
After a long train to Edinburg we picked up a rental car and start the rush to our AirBnB before it got completely dark.</description></item><item><title>Datascience Pipelines</title><link>https://cosmiccoding.com.au/blogs/dsgo/</link><pubDate>Sat, 20 Jun 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://cosmiccoding.com.au/blogs/dsgo/</guid><description>Due to COVID-19 lots of conferences have moved online in 2020. DatascienceGo is one of those conferences, and I was invited to give a workshop on datascience pipelines. This invite comes off the back of some discussions and media about my role in the COVID-19 Critical Care Consortium and creating their data processing pipeline, which has been a challenging project.
For the workshop, I thought it best to try and generalise the content slightly, and instead of talking about all the different things you can do to data and the headaches we&amp;rsquo;ve had to deal with, to instead talk about machine learning and how you can add tracking and logging to your processes super simply using the amazing mlflow library.</description></item><item><title>SDS Podcast - Pipelines</title><link>https://cosmiccoding.com.au/blogs/sds_pipelines/</link><pubDate>Thu, 21 May 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://cosmiccoding.com.au/blogs/sds_pipelines/</guid><description>Shifting away from astrophysics briefly, I talk about my experience as a lead data analyst for the COVID-19 Critical Care Consortium, and my role with them to create a data pipeline to unify, standardise and merge data from a billion different forms across multiple research projects into something that actually has value for statistical analysis and machine learning.

I had a chat with Natasha Mitchell about how this all came about, its relations to astronomy and more in an episode of Science Friction.</description></item><item><title>Barry: BAO Model Comparison</title><link>https://cosmiccoding.com.au/blogs/barry/</link><pubDate>Sun, 01 Mar 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://cosmiccoding.com.au/blogs/barry/</guid><description>BAO models are a dime a dozen these days. With multiple theroetical frameworks to start from (standard perturbation theory, Lagranian perturbation theory, effective field theory, etc), and with different models implemented to account for different physical effects, the phase space of viable BAO models is huge.
And this poses a problem for those of us wanting to utilise BAO models. How do we effectively compare them and their performance on a robust set of numerical simulations?</description></item><item><title>SDS Podcast - Hypothesis Testing</title><link>https://cosmiccoding.com.au/blogs/sds_hypothesis/</link><pubDate>Thu, 10 Oct 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://cosmiccoding.com.au/blogs/sds_hypothesis/</guid><description>I like to rant about a lot of things.

The Python in Astronomy 2019 conference was I think the best I&amp;rsquo;ve ever been to. Not because of the food or location, but because of the &amp;lsquo;unconference&amp;rsquo; sessions and the hacking that we get to do.
I wandered around during a lot of the hacks, spread between the code review hack, the MCMC exploration hack, attempting to get PRISM to run, and then also working with a group on getting a website to look at your space birthdays.</description></item><item><title>LINO19</title><link>https://cosmiccoding.com.au/blogs/lindau/</link><pubDate>Sat, 20 Jul 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://cosmiccoding.com.au/blogs/lindau/</guid><description>In the winter of 2019 I was one of the lucky students chosen to represent Australia and participate in the 2019 Lindau Nobel Laureates Meeting. The topics of the year were awesome - cosmology, gravitational waves and laser physics. What a lineup.
So here is the Australian contingent, in a very sunny lineup outside the meeting venue. We requested slight cloud cover. It was not supplied.
Inside, the hall was amazing.</description></item><item><title>SIEF Berlin</title><link>https://cosmiccoding.com.au/blogs/siefberlin/</link><pubDate>Sat, 20 Jul 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://cosmiccoding.com.au/blogs/siefberlin/</guid><description>After the Lindau Nobel Laureate Meeting all the Australian delegates packed up shop, jumped on a train and headed to Berlin. It was time for our industry tour, courtesy of the Science and Industry Endowment Fund in Australia.
There&amp;rsquo;s one main takeaway here, its that actually providing proper funding to research has some amazing benefits.
I digress. I don&amp;rsquo;t have too much to say in here apart from how great it was to see so many labs in so many areas, all working towards scientific and technological progress.</description></item><item><title>Europe Strikes Back</title><link>https://cosmiccoding.com.au/blogs/europe2019/</link><pubDate>Fri, 19 Jul 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://cosmiccoding.com.au/blogs/europe2019/</guid><description>The Zurich Introduction In a move which will surprise noone, we begin in Zurich. Unbeknown to us, it turns out that the very day we arrived in Zurich was the day they were hosting a gay pride march. Predictably, we found out about this at 5pm. After the march. Sigh.
But of course, once the official march ends, the real party begins, and there were concerts, a drag show, tons of food and general revelry.</description></item><item><title>Coding@Home</title><link>https://cosmiccoding.com.au/blogs/codingathome/</link><pubDate>Wed, 29 May 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://cosmiccoding.com.au/blogs/codingathome/</guid><description>During the school shutdown during the COVID-19 outbreak in Australia, Education Queensland partnered with Channel 10 to produce the Coding@Home series - a series of episodes available for free on TenPlay about introducing code, concepts and all the ways you can use coding in your life.
I reached out about my experiences with coding in astrophysics, and we recorded a short segment focused on machine learning, and how it has improved the lives of the average astronomer by a huge amount.</description></item><item><title>Neural Style Transfer</title><link>https://cosmiccoding.com.au/blogs/ducky/</link><pubDate>Sun, 26 May 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://cosmiccoding.com.au/blogs/ducky/</guid><description>I normally suck at giving presents. Horrifically. Probably because I&amp;rsquo;m a nightmare to buy for - I hate useless gifts. Ornaments, decorations&amp;hellip; &amp;ldquo;things&amp;rdquo; which aren&amp;rsquo;t functional.
It&amp;rsquo;s all clutter.
And because I don&amp;rsquo;t like receiving it, I don&amp;rsquo;t give it. Which means the struggle is always for a functional gift. But not this time! My sister has a cat called Ducky. Now, Ducky may not like me very much (breaks my heart), but Ali sure likes Ducky.</description></item><item><title>Pint of Science 2019</title><link>https://cosmiccoding.com.au/blogs/pint19/</link><pubDate>Tue, 21 May 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://cosmiccoding.com.au/blogs/pint19/</guid><description>I did Pint of Science originally in 2017 and had a blast. For 2018, I was stranded on a beach in Fiji and unable to participate. But for 2019, I was all in!
And because the original talk seemed to go down so well, I decided to try and challenge myself a bit more by picking a topic far harder for a general audience to visualise. I decided to talk about Baryon Acoustic Oscillations - frozen sound waves in space.</description></item><item><title>Return to Cradle Mountain</title><link>https://cosmiccoding.com.au/blogs/tasmania_2/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Apr 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://cosmiccoding.com.au/blogs/tasmania_2/</guid><description>The last time I went to Tasmania I did the Overland track.
And I was not prepared. No water-proof gear, no thick jackets, just my stubbornness. Which, as it turns out, cannot keep you warm.
So this time I cam prepared. Totally waterproof jacket. A down jacket. A merinio wool jacket! All the stops. And it was worth it. From Hobart we drove to Wineglass bay, whic was a series of ups and down designed to swell your thighs to impressive sizes.</description></item><item><title>Steve: A model for supernova cosmology</title><link>https://cosmiccoding.com.au/blogs/steve/</link><pubDate>Thu, 14 Mar 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://cosmiccoding.com.au/blogs/steve/</guid><description>As surveys discover greater numbers of supernova, our analyses become limited by systematics rather than data. Hierarchical Bayesian models are perfect for incorporating subtle effects into our model, and so I made one to do just that.
Supernova cosmology works because Type Ia supernova represent standardisable candles. That is, with a few factors taken into account, they are essentially all the same brightness. Which means, if we see two supernovae, and one is four times dimmer than the other, it must be twice as far away.</description></item><item><title>Cosmology on Safari</title><link>https://cosmiccoding.com.au/blogs/southafrica/</link><pubDate>Fri, 01 Mar 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://cosmiccoding.com.au/blogs/southafrica/</guid><description>Every two years the amazing Cosmology on Safari conference is held.
And in 2019 I was lucky enough to not only go, but present a topic clear to my heart. My own research!
Not to miss out on the opportunity to see a bit more of Africa given I was flying over anyway, I also did a small camping trip through South Africa. And Botswana. And Zimbabwe. Only dipped my toes into Namibia though.</description></item><item><title>Probably Science Podcast</title><link>https://cosmiccoding.com.au/blogs/probablyscience/</link><pubDate>Sun, 10 Feb 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://cosmiccoding.com.au/blogs/probablyscience/</guid><description>It turns out when you throw three comedians together on stage its super hard to keep up with the banter!

We had a good little chat for the hour, first going over the history of the universe.
Fourteen minutes for fourteen billion years of cosmic history, sounds doable, right? Well, you need context to appreciate the second half of the talk.
That second half was then a very short introduction to dark energy and dark matter. What they might be, why we believe so strongly that they exist</description></item><item><title>Astronomy at Gumdale</title><link>https://cosmiccoding.com.au/blogs/gumdale/</link><pubDate>Fri, 19 Oct 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://cosmiccoding.com.au/blogs/gumdale/</guid><description>Astronomy is great fun. So is coding. At least to me. But, I was invited to talk at Gumdale State School, I decided that it would be good to spread the good message out there and drum up some enthusiasm for space, science and STEM in general.
I think the trick with younger students is to constantly ask questions and get input, because talking for an hour at them will either put them to sleep or make them so restless you might as well not be talking, so that&amp;rsquo;s what I did.</description></item><item><title>Setting up a scientific python environment</title><link>https://cosmiccoding.com.au/blogs/anaconda/</link><pubDate>Mon, 30 Jul 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://cosmiccoding.com.au/blogs/anaconda/</guid><description>This writeup is primarily for the students of PHYS3080 at UQ, however it should be generally applicable. Firstly, let&amp;rsquo;s get the obvious out of the way. It&amp;rsquo;s 2018. Python 2.7 is dead. Long live Python 3!
Getting a Python Environment Up And Running So let&amp;rsquo;s get a nice python 3 environment set up. Don&amp;rsquo;t google python 3, that would be crazy. Use Anaconda.

I was curious to see how Blender&amp;rsquo;s engine would cope when the blocks were tightly packed, so, surprise surprise, I made a group of tightly packed cubes and then threw a glass sphere at them.
I randomised the materials of the cubes to add some spice, and fiddled around with simulation speed to get a slow motion section of the simulation.</description></item><item><title>The Tower of Two Blocks</title><link>https://cosmiccoding.com.au/blogs/keva/</link><pubDate>Thu, 08 Feb 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://cosmiccoding.com.au/blogs/keva/</guid><description>Seeing KEVA simulations always makes my day brighter, so I thought I&amp;rsquo;d make a small one myself. This one has a series of very light wood blocks set on top some very heavy metal blocks as the base. Two steel balls are shot at the structure, and if you watch the video you can probably guess which of them is solid and which is simply a thin shell over a hollow interior!</description></item><item><title>Solar System Size Scale</title><link>https://cosmiccoding.com.au/blogs/planets/</link><pubDate>Tue, 06 Feb 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://cosmiccoding.com.au/blogs/planets/</guid><description>{% include youtube.html url=&amp;ldquo;https://www.youtube.com/embed/JNPACDLSCTY)
This was a scene in which I learnt a lot, not just about compositing. Lots of fiddling with materials, mapping and textures to get the rocky planets working.
And then even more fiddling for the Gas Giants, to try and get that characteristic atmospheric effect along the boundary of the planet surface.
Setting up Saturn&amp;rsquo;s ring was a pain with the UV mapping, but eventually got it working!</description></item><item><title>Coloured Smoke</title><link>https://cosmiccoding.com.au/blogs/colorsmoke/</link><pubDate>Mon, 29 Jan 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://cosmiccoding.com.au/blogs/colorsmoke/</guid><description>So I wanted to see how the soft body physics worked. So alright, lets just drop a ball. But a bouncing ball is boring, so lets squash it completely. And because I could, why not have particles emit when the bottom of the ball impacts and have them shoot out.
And then because that was still dull, what if we tie the velocity of the smoke into its colour, and have it that the more dense the smoke is, the more it glows and emits light.</description></item><item><title>Gas Explosion</title><link>https://cosmiccoding.com.au/blogs/explosion/</link><pubDate>Mon, 29 Jan 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://cosmiccoding.com.au/blogs/explosion/</guid><description>It turns out that smoke simulations both take far, far longer than rigid body simulations, but also take up a lot of disk space as well. So I might have accidentally filled my main C drive on which Windows lives and had all sort of complaints come screetching out of the operating systems.
In this sim I was just trying to figure out how the volumetic shaders worked, such that I could get a two stage explosion with thick, greasy smoke.</description></item><item><title>Glowing Galton Board</title><link>https://cosmiccoding.com.au/blogs/galton/</link><pubDate>Tue, 23 Jan 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://cosmiccoding.com.au/blogs/galton/</guid><description>It&amp;rsquo;s been years since I last tried out 3D modelling and simulations. And given how crushing my PhD workload is at this point in time, I realised I needed something on the side to distract me so that my project didn&amp;rsquo;t consume all of my life.
So, after seeing the constant posts about Blender on Reddits /r/simulated sub, I decided to give it a go. Following the current hot topic (so that if anything went wrong there would be plenty of people able to help out), I decided to go with a classic Galton board simulation.</description></item><item><title>readr 2017</title><link>https://cosmiccoding.com.au/blogs/readr/</link><pubDate>Thu, 14 Dec 2017 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://cosmiccoding.com.au/blogs/readr/</guid><description>Nearing the tail end of the year I got a wonderful opportunity to expand the work I had been doing with my coding workshops to also take them to the 2017 readr retreat. readr - a research education and development retreat - is open to all undergraduate physics students in Australia, not just astrophysics students.

Fiona and I were talking to Elaine about the problems we have had with the self-taught style of coding the most astronomers work with, specifically the lack of structure, documentation and testing that so often accompanies astronomical projects and packages.
To fix this, we volunteered to run a code workshop, with a focus on teaching the astronomical community better coding standards, better practises, giving them better tools and better resources.</description></item><item><title>Desert Caves Map</title><link>https://cosmiccoding.com.au/blogs/map-caves/</link><pubDate>Sun, 17 Sep 2017 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://cosmiccoding.com.au/blogs/map-caves/</guid><description>Presenting, some desert caves, cave system, lava basin, dubiously engineered bridges, and small encampment! The idea for this one was after climbing down the hole in the previous map you would end up in the top right corner of this map.
Once again, following the style of Mark Bowen&amp;rsquo;s maps over at Blue Sword Games.
So, for this map, here are the outlines and grid versions:
And because the lava is very visually strong, if you want the play area to be more of the focus than the lava, use this image:</description></item><item><title>Desert Camp Map</title><link>https://cosmiccoding.com.au/blogs/map-camp/</link><pubDate>Sat, 16 Sep 2017 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://cosmiccoding.com.au/blogs/map-camp/</guid><description>Presenting, a desert camp, with included outcrops, interior cave and hole of mystery!
Once again, following the style of Mark Bowen&amp;rsquo;s maps over at Blue Sword Games, my second desert map.
I decided I wanted the map to have a few potential uses.
Make camp, and be ambused from outside, and use the cave choke point to hold them off. Have creatures ascend from the hole and attack the camp from inside the cave.</description></item><item><title>Desert Canyon Map</title><link>https://cosmiccoding.com.au/blogs/map-canyon/</link><pubDate>Wed, 13 Sep 2017 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://cosmiccoding.com.au/blogs/map-canyon/</guid><description>Presenting, a desert canyon, with included creek, small rock pillars, and larger overhanging boulder, for your consideration!

I&amp;rsquo;ve recently been collecting maps for potential use in some upcoming campaign, and I absolutely love the art style of Mark Bowen&amp;rsquo;s maps over at Blue Sword Games.
I highly recommend checking it out!
So I&amp;rsquo;ve been following his map making progress, and decided that - given I want more maps than are available - I should make some to fill in the blanks for the current scaffold.</description></item><item><title>Making Taipan's Logo</title><link>https://cosmiccoding.com.au/blogs/taipan/</link><pubDate>Tue, 12 Sep 2017 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://cosmiccoding.com.au/blogs/taipan/</guid><description>I think a good way to not get burnt out coding and doing math 24/7 a day is to do some more creative work to break the monotony.
Or perhaps I am simply bad at saying &amp;ldquo;No!&amp;rdquo;
The moral of the story is that I took over makign the Taipan logo for the Taipan survey. The original art was all done in green, and I thought - given the lack of green colouring in many astronomical surveys, and given the snake is vaguely green(ish brown), sure, sounds good!</description></item><item><title>Physics in the Pub</title><link>https://cosmiccoding.com.au/blogs/pub/</link><pubDate>Tue, 15 Aug 2017 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://cosmiccoding.com.au/blogs/pub/</guid><description>Physics in the Pub came to Brisbane!

Chris Mesiku sang a reggae song about $$E=mc^2$$ and Einstein. Phil himself sang a cover of Nirvana about particle physics and light.</description></item><item><title>Battle of the Brains</title><link>https://cosmiccoding.com.au/blogs/botb/</link><pubDate>Sun, 13 Aug 2017 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://cosmiccoding.com.au/blogs/botb/</guid><description>As part of The Science Nation&amp;rsquo;s National Science Week set of activities, I was given the opportunity to participate in Battle of the Brains! Andrew Stephenson hosted the event, and kept the six guest scientists neatly in line throughout the event.
We set up on stage, I of course didn&amp;rsquo;t speak into the microphone correctly, and an audience member came up and adjusted it mid-sentence to much laughter.
It was a great night where I got nearly every question wrong!</description></item><item><title>What is OzDES?</title><link>https://cosmiccoding.com.au/blogs/ozdes/</link><pubDate>Wed, 02 Aug 2017 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://cosmiccoding.com.au/blogs/ozdes/</guid><description>Sometimes I think I get a big bogged down, lost in a maze of code that I used to be the master of before losing my bearing. At times like this, it is prudent to take a step back, to let the maze untangle itself slowly whilst one focuses on other tasks.
Or at least, that is my excuse for picking up side work. In the latest installment of &amp;ldquo;No, I don&amp;rsquo;t have results from my PhD yet,&amp;rdquo; I present the following post on OzDES, its purpose, goals and how it goes about fulfilling them.</description></item><item><title>Visiting Chicago</title><link>https://cosmiccoding.com.au/blogs/chicago/</link><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jun 2017 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://cosmiccoding.com.au/blogs/chicago/</guid><description>Once again escaping the Australian winter, I found myself residing in the temperate Bay area. But I was still cold. And so to Chicago I went&amp;hellip; coincidentally, this was at the same time as a DES collaboration meeting.
This visit now marks my greatest journey east into the US. I would have liked to go to New York and visit the city, just to make that statement incorrect, but alas, neither time nor money can be spared for such an adventure.</description></item><item><title>Pint of Science 2017</title><link>https://cosmiccoding.com.au/blogs/pint/</link><pubDate>Mon, 15 May 2017 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://cosmiccoding.com.au/blogs/pint/</guid><description>During the week of the 14th of May there were a host of Pint of Science events presented in Brisbane. Josh and I did one together - Josh presented a talk Dark matter, what&amp;rsquo;s the matter?, where he talked about the dark universe, and potential candidates for dark matter. I gave a talk The Brightest Fireworks in the Universe - on supernovae, their lives, deaths and role in the universe.</description></item><item><title>Making a utility knife</title><link>https://cosmiccoding.com.au/blogs/knife/</link><pubDate>Tue, 18 Apr 2017 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://cosmiccoding.com.au/blogs/knife/</guid><description>For a while now I&amp;rsquo;ve been meaning to see if I can make something a bit more useful than my normal projects, and what could be more useful than a knife? Well, a lot of things, but most things are simply too difficult and require too many tools I don&amp;rsquo;t have!
So, in preparation built a gas forge with tons of help from the guys at QMAC, and then built a simply filing jig to help me out.</description></item><item><title>ScopeTV Guest Scientist</title><link>https://cosmiccoding.com.au/blogs/scope/</link><pubDate>Sat, 25 Mar 2017 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://cosmiccoding.com.au/blogs/scope/</guid><description>Every now and then ScopeTV has a space focused episode, and they look up some local scientists to help present the content for one of their episodes. Janie and I were asked if we wanted to participate in an episode focused on the size and scale of the solar system, and obviously we thought it was a great idea, so we jumped on it!
I&amp;rsquo;m sure you&amp;rsquo;ve seen similar demonstrations - start with the sun a huge ball that you can barely carry, and work your way down to the other planets at physically accurate (albeit scaled down) distances.</description></item><item><title>Famelab 2017</title><link>https://cosmiccoding.com.au/blogs/famelab/</link><pubDate>Tue, 21 Mar 2017 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://cosmiccoding.com.au/blogs/famelab/</guid><description>Famelab is a science communication challenge where PhD students have three minutes, no slides, no video and one prop - if they so choose - to share your thesis work to a live audience!
I prepared a short segment on supernovae and their role in the universe. But before the night itself, we had a short segement with Rebecca Levingston on ABC&amp;rsquo;s Saturday Breakfast radio. It was my first radio spot, and I admit I was definitely not as eloquent as I wanted!</description></item><item><title>Refractorium</title><link>https://cosmiccoding.com.au/blogs/refractorium/</link><pubDate>Tue, 07 Mar 2017 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://cosmiccoding.com.au/blogs/refractorium/</guid><description>Click here to run the simulator in your browser. I was browsing Reddit&amp;rsquo;s Simulated subreddit one afternoon and came across a nice GPU voxel fluid animation. Whilst reading up how it was engineered, I stumbled onto a project by Benedikt Bitterli called Tantalum.
It was a GPU accelerated 2D light transport simulator, and I spent at least an hour playing around with it and producing some beautiful caustics. But with Tantalum, you can only control the position and angle of the light source - the rest of the scene was static.</description></item><item><title>Making bismuth crystals</title><link>https://cosmiccoding.com.au/blogs/bismuth/</link><pubDate>Mon, 27 Feb 2017 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://cosmiccoding.com.au/blogs/bismuth/</guid><description>Josh Calcino and I were in Japan on a holiday recently, and we spent a fair bit of time in some of the larger crystal shops they had in Kyoto - we both collected crystals when we were younger. We saw some beautiful pieces of bismuth, and I came close to buying some.
Instead, we decided to buy some raw bismuth when we got back home and make the crystals ourselves!</description></item><item><title>Making a Moon Mosaic</title><link>https://cosmiccoding.com.au/blogs/moon/</link><pubDate>Fri, 10 Feb 2017 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://cosmiccoding.com.au/blogs/moon/</guid><description>I was at the Dark Energy Survey conference in December when I met an overachieving student. Three years in, and already using the telescope at the University of Sussex to do additional projects, including a moon mosaic.
Jessica, the student in question, had never made a mosaic before. Luckily, I had done it once or twice for past work for Gemini, and so I offered to help. Three hundred images I received of the moon.</description></item><item><title>Japan Winter Holiday</title><link>https://cosmiccoding.com.au/blogs/japan/</link><pubDate>Wed, 08 Feb 2017 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://cosmiccoding.com.au/blogs/japan/</guid><description>It&amp;rsquo;s good to get away sometimes.
Especially good if you make sure you don&amp;rsquo;t bring a laptop - no sneaky working during a holiday!
So in January 2017, I went to Japan. First stop, Mt Fuji.
After Fuji, straight to Kyoto. We went to a few of the shrines, the Silver and Golden Palaces, and the Fushimi Inari Shrine.
I didn&amp;rsquo;t quite realise how big the Fushimi Inari Shrine was - its not just one or two arches, there are kilometers of them.</description></item><item><title>An Evening with Dr Lisa Randall</title><link>https://cosmiccoding.com.au/blogs/lisa/</link><pubDate>Thu, 17 Nov 2016 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://cosmiccoding.com.au/blogs/lisa/</guid><description>In November 2016, Lisa Randall gave an Australian tour in the big cities. As normal for ThinkInc events, they had a local scientist give an introductory talk to warm up the audience.
I decided to give a brief talk about the current state of physics, and gave a brief explanation of the physics behind the Hubble Space Telescope, the Large Hadron Collider, eLISA, LIGO and a few other great experiments.</description></item><item><title>Uluru Astronomer in Residence</title><link>https://cosmiccoding.com.au/blogs/uluru/</link><pubDate>Sat, 01 Oct 2016 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://cosmiccoding.com.au/blogs/uluru/</guid><description>I highly recommend this experience to all other CAASTRO students. I was only at Ayers Rock Resort for a week and enjoyed myself immensely. The time you have to talk to the general public, play educational games with the kids, answer interesting questions at the AstroTours and take your own pictures of the night sky makes it a great experience.
I was an emergency replacement, hence why I went for one week and not two, however one week was plenty of time to settle into a comfortable routine focused on public outreach.</description></item><item><title>Survey Visualiser</title><link>https://cosmiccoding.com.au/blogs/surveyvis/</link><pubDate>Sun, 04 Sep 2016 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://cosmiccoding.com.au/blogs/surveyvis/</guid><description>I was making a poster for the CAASTRO annual retreat on my BAO work, and realised what it really needed was a nice comparison of the WiggleZ survey compared to other more local surveys, to highlight the redshift depth of WiggleZ in comparison to other surveys of the same period, such as 2dF.
And because I am a stubborn fool, I decided to extend what I did to the general case.</description></item><item><title>ChainConsumer</title><link>https://cosmiccoding.com.au/blogs/chainconsumer/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Aug 2016 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://cosmiccoding.com.au/blogs/chainconsumer/</guid><description>I was working with some chains one day and wanted to plot different cosmologies against each other, and realised that they had different parameters. Unfortunately, this meant that the library I was using couldn&amp;rsquo;t handle the task, so I wrote my own!
If you want to know more and see plenty of examples see the online documentation here.
The API is fairly straightforward I hope, with a simple example shown below.</description></item><item><title>LBNL - California</title><link>https://cosmiccoding.com.au/blogs/california/</link><pubDate>Fri, 08 Jul 2016 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://cosmiccoding.com.au/blogs/california/</guid><description>In the Australian summer of 2016 I went to study at Lawrence Berkeley National Labs for a couple of months with Alex Kim, working on my Bayesian model for supernova cosmology.
It was a very productive time, but that isn&amp;rsquo;t what this page is about; this page is about what I got up to outside of work.
The first thing to do when near San Francisco is to go to the Golden Gate Bridge.</description></item><item><title>Get Lit; Atlassian Ship-It</title><link>https://cosmiccoding.com.au/blogs/getlit/</link><pubDate>Mon, 18 Apr 2016 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://cosmiccoding.com.au/blogs/getlit/</guid><description>Thanks to the wonderful Kate Gunn, CAASTRO managed to participated in one of Atlassian&amp;rsquo;s Ship-It hackathons. I joined the team, along with Bonnie, Steven, Anais, Richard to make the CAASTRO counterpart, with Atlassian providing two staff members, Jason and Ivor in case we needed some heavy software lifting done. The project idea and all the initial hard work was put in by Steven - we wanted to create a better way to search for scientific papers, given that Google doesn&amp;rsquo;t work, and NASA&amp;rsquo;s ADS system is a bit&amp;hellip; rough.</description></item><item><title>Gemini - La Serena, Chile</title><link>https://cosmiccoding.com.au/blogs/gemini/</link><pubDate>Sun, 21 Feb 2016 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://cosmiccoding.com.au/blogs/gemini/</guid><description>Part One: The drafting They shipped us off December 8th. Three students sent out to the Gemini telescope in La Serena, Chile, to see what they could make of the situation. To see if they could survive.
I remember it like it was last just last month.
By some coincidence, it was. Exactly. I&amp;rsquo;m writing this on the 8th of January, at 5pm, after finishing a day of work.
This is us.</description></item><item><title>Detecting Globular Clusters</title><link>https://cosmiccoding.com.au/blogs/globular/</link><pubDate>Sat, 20 Feb 2016 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://cosmiccoding.com.au/blogs/globular/</guid><description>In my time over at Gemini in La Serena, I worked on a project to distinguish globular clusters from stars. The globular clusters (GCs) were located in the giant elliptical galaxy Maffei 1, which - whilst being very close to us - requires looking through the middle of our galaxy.
You do not want this.
The dust extinction was through the roof. I used the SDFRED data reduction pipeline to process images from the Subaru telescope, giving me the output image below.</description></item><item><title>WiggleZ 2D BAO</title><link>https://cosmiccoding.com.au/blogs/bao/</link><pubDate>Tue, 20 Oct 2015 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://cosmiccoding.com.au/blogs/bao/</guid><description>Shall we just jump right into it? The slightly wiggles you can see around $$k=0.1 \rm{h/Mpc}$$ below, when transformed into a correlation function via the Spherical Hankel transformation, turn into that big peak in the right hand plot. As you may have guessed, said &amp;ldquo;big peak&amp;rdquo; is the oscillation of interest. Put simply, it represents a characteristic separation at which there is an overdensity of matter in the universe. And its of interest because this peak has existed since the first galaxies formed, and so we can use it as a standard ruler.</description></item><item><title>Kubo Oscillator</title><link>https://cosmiccoding.com.au/blogs/kubo/</link><pubDate>Thu, 20 Aug 2015 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://cosmiccoding.com.au/blogs/kubo/</guid><description>I&amp;rsquo;ll be honest: this post was made just to show of one of my favourite plots. I&amp;rsquo;ll put it at the end, because without an introduction it really doesn&amp;rsquo;t make too much sense.
Firstly, a terrifying brief (and thus completely inaccurate) introduction to stochastic systems: A stochastic system is one in which the outcome of an individual system is unpredictable due to the effect of randomness.
Brownian motion (the motion of a particle being jostled around by other particles) is the classic example of this.</description></item><item><title>Overland Track - Tasmania</title><link>https://cosmiccoding.com.au/blogs/tasmania/</link><pubDate>Thu, 01 Jan 2015 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://cosmiccoding.com.au/blogs/tasmania/</guid><description>After uni was over one year, Julia told me she was thinking of doing the overland track in Tasmania. I had heard good things about the track, and so I decided to tag along!
I got some army rations off my mate Chris, and bought a ton of food from the store, loaded up some clothes and tools, threw them in my hiking back pack, and off we went.
The initial climb and day was marred by wet weather, but still offered some great views.</description></item><item><title>Marz</title><link>https://cosmiccoding.com.au/blogs/marz/</link><pubDate>Mon, 20 Oct 2014 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://cosmiccoding.com.au/blogs/marz/</guid><description>Marz was a program I first started coding for my undergraduate software engineering thesis. The OzDES team was spending too much time manually redshifting spectra and wanted some improvements to the workflow done. I could either improve Runz (the software used at the time), or create something from scratch.
Guess which one I picked?
After lots of work, hassle and one side arguments with my computer, I managed to actually get something usable!</description></item><item><title>European Holiday</title><link>https://cosmiccoding.com.au/blogs/europe/</link><pubDate>Thu, 20 Jun 2013 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://cosmiccoding.com.au/blogs/europe/</guid><description>Its hard to condense down such a big trip into less than a small book, but here goes. Started in London, went to Paris &amp;amp; Nice. Travelled down to Rome, patted a lot of stray cats in the colosseum. Went to Monaco, and then to Munich (which was the best). Munich to the Rhine valley, and form there to the Netherlands.
Definitely am going to go back, especially to Germany and the Netherlands, once I have some time and money.</description></item><item><title>DJ Board</title><link>https://cosmiccoding.com.au/blogs/dj/</link><pubDate>Sat, 01 Jun 2013 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://cosmiccoding.com.au/blogs/dj/</guid><description>My first team project was to make a pseudo-satellite. Two years later, better equipped, I was hoping the second project would be to built the rocket. Instead, we got a DJ board. People said I had unrealistically high expectations.
Maybe so.
The challenge of the DJ board was not conceptual, it was to be able to do it all on the tiny processor they gave us, which had essentially no memory.</description></item><item><title>Laser Satellite</title><link>https://cosmiccoding.com.au/blogs/satellite/</link><pubDate>Fri, 01 Jun 2012 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://cosmiccoding.com.au/blogs/satellite/</guid><description>This was my first proper team project. Myself, Jeevan, Kiaran and David, tasked to built a device which, whilst suspended from a single thin wire, would be able to detected infrared sources, target them, and then fire a laser back at them to hit a bullseye underneath.
In other words, an awesome project.
Like all good satellites, you try and keep mechanical design simple. Less moving parts means less points of failure.</description></item><item><title>The Most Useless Machine</title><link>https://cosmiccoding.com.au/blogs/box/</link><pubDate>Thu, 28 Jul 2011 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://cosmiccoding.com.au/blogs/box/</guid><description>The year before this, I created a thick paper mache wrapper around a present to make it more interesting to unwrap. So in 2011 I decided to do a take on the &amp;ldquo;Most Useless Machine Ever&amp;rdquo; - a box that&amp;rsquo;s sole function is to flip a switch back to its off position when a user flicks it on.
{% include youtube.html url=&amp;ldquo;https://www.youtube.com/embed/2LKnORvwsoI)
Mechanically, this is simple, the flick just needs to be connected to a DC motor switch, such that either side of the switch changes the voltage across the motor.</description></item><item><title>Mood Bottle</title><link>https://cosmiccoding.com.au/blogs/bottle/</link><pubDate>Wed, 01 Jun 2011 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://cosmiccoding.com.au/blogs/bottle/</guid><description>The image you see was sourced from a similar Instructibles that I recommend you check out.
