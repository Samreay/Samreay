I&amp;rsquo;ll focus upon the first few books here (Unsouled, Soulsmith, Blackflame) and try to keep spoilers for the rest of the series locked away in my heart.
The story follows a young man hailing from one of the clans of Sacred Valley. This is Lindon. He is, shall we say, unfairly treated by the clan, who believes he has no aptitude for the spiritual arts.</description></item><item><title>A Review of nobody13's Mother of Learning. Time loops with a smart protagonist, done so very, very right.</title><link>https://cosmiccoding.com.au/reviews/mother_of_learning/</link><pubDate>Wed, 08 Sep 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://cosmiccoding.com.au/reviews/mother_of_learning/</guid><description>I grew up on the Belgariad, graduated through Harry Potter to the Wheel of Time, conquered Malazan, was crushed by the Farseer Trilogy, and generally docked my ship at every fantasy port I could find.
Then I was recommended to read Mother of Learning. It was my first serial novel. And despite its 800k words, I read it in a week.
And then I read it again.
So many books I&amp;rsquo;ve read fumble the ending or the rising tension.</description></item><item><title>A Review of Bryce O'Connor's Iron Prince. Scifi progression on actual digital steroids."</title><link>https://cosmiccoding.com.au/reviews/iron_prince/</link><pubDate>Tue, 20 Jul 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://cosmiccoding.com.au/reviews/iron_prince/</guid><description>I normally approach scifi with skepticism. I studied astrophysics, and physics is a harsh mistress that is all to easy to try and abuse in works of science fiction. There&amp;rsquo;s one surefire way around this - magical tech. Or in this case, alien tech that is so advanced it might as well be magic. And with the soft scifi setting established, this allows Bryce to draw the best from fantasy, the best from LitRPG levelling, and combine them to make one of the best progression fantasy stories I have read in years.</description></item><item><title>A Review of Andrew Rowe's Arcane Ascension Series: hard magic done right</title><link>https://cosmiccoding.com.au/reviews/arcane_ascension/</link><pubDate>Sat, 30 Jan 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://cosmiccoding.com.au/reviews/arcane_ascension/</guid><description>My rating is for the series as a whole as of writing. It&amp;rsquo;s amazing. I&amp;rsquo;ll make sure this review focuses on Book One: Sufficiently Advanced Magic.
Corin Cadence is one of my favourite main characters in all of fantasy. He is, as I image many of us think, how we would approach being a person in a magical world. Analytically. Carefully. Exploitively.
So here&amp;rsquo;s the plot - you get powers (attunements) ostensibly from the goddess, via blessings you receive in the spires.</description></item><item><title>Reflections on my own 'Soul Relic'</title><link>https://cosmiccoding.com.au/reviews/soul_relic/</link><pubDate>Mon, 20 Jun 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://cosmiccoding.com.au/reviews/soul_relic/</guid><description>Born with an enormous well of power but no way to regenerate it, Raysha will risk anything to fix herself, even if it means venturing into the unknown with nothing but her brother, an enchanted water bottle, and a stubborn attitude.
Without the ability to cultivate aeon from the world, Raysha has been treated like an outcast her whole life. While she has to ration her power drop-by-drop, others use it as commonly as breathing.</description></item><item><title>A Review of Phil Tucker's Bastion. It's great.</title><link>https://cosmiccoding.com.au/reviews/bastion/</link><pubDate>Wed, 17 Nov 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://cosmiccoding.com.au/reviews/bastion/</guid><description>Many progression fantasy series start with a similar pattern. An unfortunate, downtrodden, or unlucky individual is wronged, usually in an academic or sect environment, and then they claw their way through the classes, pushing themselves into excellence.
Bastion opens similarly, and I was preparing myself for a bit of &amp;lsquo;more of the same&amp;rsquo;. When the Chancellor starts explaining a points system for Academic progression through the Gauntlet (aka dungeon / spire / magical testing realm) a spark of worry lit inside me.</description></item><item><title>A Review of John Bierce's Mage Errant Series. A fun ride with a likeable cast.</title><link>https://cosmiccoding.com.au/reviews/mage_errant/</link><pubDate>Fri, 19 Nov 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://cosmiccoding.com.au/reviews/mage_errant/</guid><description>This review focuses on first volume. As of writing I&amp;rsquo;ve read all five released books and those flavour my opinion.
Hugh of Emblin is both a horrific and talented student at Skyhold Academy.
He is anxious, I&amp;rsquo;m pretty sure he is depressed, and ultimately he is just not vibing about the state of the world and his own abilities.
Luckily, he has some great friends to help pick him up and support him.</description></item><item><title>A review of J.M. Clarke's 'Mark of the Fool'</title><link>https://cosmiccoding.com.au/reviews/mark_of_the_fool/</link><pubDate>Fri, 30 Sep 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://cosmiccoding.com.au/reviews/mark_of_the_fool/</guid><description>As of writing this review, I have read the KU release and up to chapter 200, which is about half-way through the available chapters.
So here&amp;rsquo;s the premise: Alex Roth is one of five chosen Heroes that need to defeat a reoccurring villain: The Ravener. Alex, however, is the Fool. His Mark, instead of making him a combat savant, powerful spellcaster, etc, makes him really great at learning things that are outside of combat and spellcasting&amp;hellip; but will actively interfere with his abilities if they are not.</description></item><item><title>A review of Naomi Novik's Scholomance Series</title><link>https://cosmiccoding.com.au/reviews/scholomance/</link><pubDate>Sun, 15 May 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://cosmiccoding.com.au/reviews/scholomance/</guid><description>I didn&amp;rsquo;t expect to read a book from the perspective of an emotional teenage girl and love every page.
And yet, here we are.
So, premise time. In this world, there are magical people, and not magical people (they&amp;rsquo;re not called muggles though). Raising a magical kid is hard, because there are a whole host of creatures, called maleficaria (or mals) which love that sweet mana inside the kids, and will eat them all up.</description></item><item><title>A Review of Matt Dinniman's Dungeon Crawler Carl. Officially my favourite LitRPG.</title><link>https://cosmiccoding.com.au/reviews/dungeon_crawler_carl/</link><pubDate>Mon, 10 Jan 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://cosmiccoding.com.au/reviews/dungeon_crawler_carl/</guid><description>Dungeon Crawler Carl opens with something reminiscent of Hitchhiker&amp;rsquo;s Guide to the Galaxy. Earth is being mined for minerals, and those that survived the initial population purge become participants in the universe&amp;rsquo;s most popular show, as they progress through a deadly dungeon run by an insane AI to either try and survive or beat the dungeon and win back their planet.
Now that is a fun premise.
Carl enters the dungeon with Princess Donut, a prize-winning cat.</description></item><item><title>A review of Sarah Lin's 'The Weirkey Chronicles'</title><link>https://cosmiccoding.com.au/reviews/weirkey/</link><pubDate>Wed, 17 Aug 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://cosmiccoding.com.au/reviews/weirkey/</guid><description>As of writing this, I have read all five released books, and will be picking up the next whenever it comes out!
Our MC, Theo, has spent decades searching for a way back into the magical realms of the Nine Worlds. After a bitter life with no success, he eventually finds his way back, only to confront the fact that the ideals of his younger self are only a distant memory to the man he now is.</description></item><item><title>A review of Rob J.

Born talentless, Iro has all but resigned himself to a life of drudgery, watching his sister hop across to the massive space titan for supplies. But when the titan explodes and his sister is killed, Iro finds a new determination to take her place. Heâ€™s not about to let weakness prevent him.
When the fleet encounters a new titan, filled with powerful monsters, deadly traps, and mysterious cloaked figures, Iro is the first to spontaneously manifest a new talent.</description></item><item><title>A review of J.R.

After tragically losing the only person he ever cared about, Alexander, a rogue artificial intelligence, opens a portal to an alternate dimension to escape his grief.
Scanning trillions of different dimensions, Alexander finally finds a world that is reminiscent of the only time he was ever happy, back when he could play virtual reality games with his only friend. He doesn&amp;rsquo;t know why, or how, such a world exists, but he doesn&amp;rsquo;t care.</description></item><item><title>A Review of CasualFarmer's Cultivation novel 'Beware of Chicken'</title><link>https://cosmiccoding.com.au/reviews/beware_of_chicken/</link><pubDate>Sun, 01 May 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://cosmiccoding.com.au/reviews/beware_of_chicken/</guid><description>As of writing this review, I have read all 212 published chapters on Royal Road.
I saw this series recommended a few times on various groups and subreddits, but I always put it off because the name of the series didn&amp;rsquo;t exactly give me details about what it was about. The tidal wave of support for the work pushed me over the edge, so I picked it up&amp;hellip; and it turns out that was a great decision.</description></item><item><title>A Review of J. R.

It even got a shoutout from Bryce O&amp;rsquo;Connor, and then, after about ten more people told me to read it, I pulled the trigger, added it to my Kindle, and then I read the entire thing&amp;mdash;all eight hundred pages&amp;mdash;in a single weekend.
So yeah, I thought it was pretty good.</description></item><item><title>A review of Rhaegar's 'Azarinth Healer'</title><link>https://cosmiccoding.com.au/reviews/azarinth_healer/</link><pubDate>Sun, 04 Dec 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://cosmiccoding.com.au/reviews/azarinth_healer/</guid><description>Blurb Ilea likes punching things. And eating.
Unfortunately, there arenâ€™t too many career options for hungry brawlers. Instead, the plan is to quit her crappy fast-food job, go to college, and become a fully functioning member of society. Essentially - a fate worse than death.
So maybe it&amp;rsquo;s lucky that she wakes up one day in a strange world where a bunch of fantasy monsters are trying to kill her&amp;hellip;?</description></item><item><title>A review of Striker's 'Virtuous Sons'</title><link>https://cosmiccoding.com.au/reviews/virtuous_sons/</link><pubDate>Fri, 11 Nov 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://cosmiccoding.com.au/reviews/virtuous_sons/</guid><description>Blurb Lio Aetos is the Young Aristocrat and heir apparent to a legendary Greek sect, a prodigious talent born and bred for glory.
Solus is a slave, a disgraced patrician from the fallen city of Rome with nothing to his name.
They&amp;rsquo;re as different as the East is from the West. Yet both of them hungerâ€”to cast off the threads of Fate theyâ€™ve been given. To reach for a higher purpose.</description></item><item><title>A review of RavensDagger's 'Cinnamon Bun'</title><link>https://cosmiccoding.com.au/reviews/cinnamon_bun/</link><pubDate>Fri, 23 Sep 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://cosmiccoding.com.au/reviews/cinnamon_bun/</guid><description>As readers of this genre know, LitRPG worlds can be a depressing, harrowing, and cut-throat place. Half of the MC&amp;rsquo;s I&amp;rsquo;ve read in other works get ahead because this suits them just fine. They&amp;rsquo;re happy to fight, happy to get their hands dirty, happy to shake the system up. In many ways, that&amp;rsquo;s part of the escapism. Having power.
Cinnamon Bun has a slightly different take. The world is less apocalyptic in fashion, and our main character, Broccoli Bunch, just wants to go on cool adventures and make friends.</description></item><item><title>A review of Alec Huston's 'Umbral Storm'</title><link>https://cosmiccoding.com.au/reviews/umbral_storm/</link><pubDate>Wed, 30 Nov 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://cosmiccoding.com.au/reviews/umbral_storm/</guid><description>Blurb A thousand years ago the Heart of the World was shattered, its fragments scattered across the lands. In the chaos that followed, martial orders arose to gather these shards, for it was found that great powers were granted when these pieces were bonded to the flesh of the chosen. These are the Sharded Few, warriors imbued with the divine energies that once coursed through the Heart, and driven to absorb enough fragments to claim godhood.</description></item><item><title>A review of Harmon Cooper's 'The World According to Dragons'</title><link>https://cosmiccoding.com.au/reviews/the_world_according_to_dragons/</link><pubDate>Thu, 03 Nov 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://cosmiccoding.com.au/reviews/the_world_according_to_dragons/</guid><description>Blurb An infamous relic hunter. A legendary dragon. The journey of a lifetime.
Twillo lies bleeding out in a volcanic desert. Towering over him is a snarling red wolf, death only seconds away.
Right as his vision is going black, a mysterious voice offers Twillo a chance at survival.
Do you agree to bind souls?
It is the voice of a dragon, one that hasn&amp;rsquo;t been seen for hundreds of years.</description></item><item><title>A review of Davis Ashura's 'The Eternal Ephemera'</title><link>https://cosmiccoding.com.au/reviews/eternal_ephemera/</link><pubDate>Thu, 20 Oct 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://cosmiccoding.com.au/reviews/eternal_ephemera/</guid><description>As of writing this review, I have read Blood of a Novice, and received a copy as an ARC reader.
Blurb Cam Folde will shake the very fabric of creation&amp;hellip; or see all his hopes turn to ash.
The son of the town drunk, Cam never figured on letting his family name hold him down. He always strove to dream bigger, to fight for something better, to achieve more than what everyone else expected of him.</description></item><item><title>A Review of Tobias Begley's progression fantasy work 'The Enchanter'</title><link>https://cosmiccoding.com.au/reviews/enchanter/</link><pubDate>Fri, 15 Apr 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://cosmiccoding.com.au/reviews/enchanter/</guid><description>Let&amp;rsquo;s get the obvious out the way and let me expand on the description above. If you&amp;rsquo;ve read the Arcane Ascension series and loved Corin&amp;rsquo;s approach to life, just save yourself some time, click the amazon link above, and go and get this book. If you haven&amp;rsquo;t, but you&amp;rsquo;ve read Mother of Learning and appreciated Zorian there, same comment.
Alright, let&amp;rsquo;s start with a spoiler-free summary.

Hilarious love letter to Zelda.</title><link>https://cosmiccoding.com.au/reviews/how_to_defeat_a_demon_king_in_ten_easy_steps/</link><pubDate>Wed, 12 Jan 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://cosmiccoding.com.au/reviews/how_to_defeat_a_demon_king_in_ten_easy_steps/</guid><description>Let&amp;rsquo;s preface this real quick: this book is a short and fun read. It is not a sweeping fantasy series, it is not a classic zero-to-hero progression fantasy. It is a love letter to Zelda and other games, making fun of many video game tropes by highlighting just how ridiculous and obvious many are.
The main character finds a way to inventively use their class (A Bag Mage) to break various game systems.</description></item><item><title>A review of T.J.

For those wanting to get straight into action and cultivation, don&amp;rsquo;t skip over this book. The first small arc sets up the main character, the world, and the cultures in it wonderfully.
The story follows the Quiet Luca, a soldier whose core didn&amp;rsquo;t awaken, who served in the squad of stone-bending cultivators.</description></item><item><title>A review of Maxime J. Durand's 'The Perfect Run'</title><link>https://cosmiccoding.com.au/reviews/perfect_run/</link><pubDate>Sun, 15 May 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://cosmiccoding.com.au/reviews/perfect_run/</guid><description>It&amp;rsquo;s been a quite a few years since the Alchemist distributed Elixirs into the world, each which grant a unique super power. Since then, modern civilisation has collapsed, because giving some people phenomenal power tends to go badly a lot of the time. Quicksave begins the book searching for his childhood friend, Len, and determined to go through every chapter in his life with a perfect run. Which, as you might have guessed from the hero name, is possible thanks to his ability to set a checkpoint in time he can revert to on death.</description></item><item><title>A Review of Dakota Krout's Completionist Chronicles and Ritualist from a grumpy LitRPG reader</title><link>https://cosmiccoding.com.au/reviews/completionist_chronicles/</link><pubDate>Mon, 03 May 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://cosmiccoding.com.au/reviews/completionist_chronicles/</guid><description>Completionist Chronicles is set in the same universe as Divine Dungeon. Or more so, it&amp;rsquo;s set inside the Dungeon, with a weird tie into modern-day Earth. I&amp;rsquo;ll focus this write-up on the first book, Ritualist.
Let&amp;rsquo;s get that out of the way - the book has a weird opening. It&amp;rsquo;s the end of the world, and President Elon [Musk] encourages everyone to start a new life in a new world before vanishing into thin air (transported into the dungeon&amp;rsquo;s constructed LitRPG world).</description></item><item><title>A review of J.L.

Blurb The world is wild, untamed. Humanity thrives, but only in isolated, well defended cities, ever shrinking as the wilds slowly reclaim all that was taken. The most capable magic users are raised up as Mages to serve mankind, further their cause, and defend them over the course of millennia.
Tala is freshly graduated from the magic academy and determined to make her own way in the world.</description></item><item><title>A review of Michael G.

Our plot follows Will, who awakens his magic when healing a young boys infection. He is sent to live with his grandfather (of sorts), who becomes a slow and painful magical tutelage, laced with acerbic dialogue and insults around every corner. The dynamic between the two is a joy to read. Eventually, the plot moves on, Will has to spread his wings. As to why, and when, and how, I won&amp;rsquo;t say, because it all falls under spoiler territory.</description></item><item><title>A Review of C. Mantis' 'The Path of Ascension', a sci-fi wuxia novel with a staggering range of powers and power divides.</title><link>https://cosmiccoding.com.au/reviews/path_ascension/</link><pubDate>Tue, 01 Mar 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://cosmiccoding.com.au/reviews/path_ascension/</guid><description>This was another read courtesy of recommendations from /r/ProgressionFantasy. It&amp;rsquo;s only on Royal Road (at the time of writing), but I hope it reaches a wider audience soon when the author has a chance to go back and package it all up nicely.
The Path of Ascension follows the journey of our tragically orphaned MC, Matt. Matt&amp;rsquo;s parents were killed in a rift break. If you&amp;rsquo;ve read Solo Levelling or many other rift/portal/dunegon based novels, this is fairly standard.</description></item><item><title>A review of KamikazePotato's 'An Outcast In Another World'</title><link>https://cosmiccoding.com.au/reviews/outcast_in_another_world/</link><pubDate>Thu, 04 Aug 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://cosmiccoding.com.au/reviews/outcast_in_another_world/</guid><description>This review was written after I had read all three published books. I&amp;rsquo;m waiting on the Kindle version instead of reading on RR so I can give the author my money.
If you liked HWFWM, Defiance of the Fall, Primal Hunter, or Randidly, you&amp;rsquo;ll like this series.
Initially, I was worried when the starting chapters felt very close to both DoT and Primal Hunter. Young white man in a forest with dangerous beasts&amp;hellip; I&amp;rsquo;ve read that few too many times for it to still hold the magic it originally held with me.</description></item><item><title>A review of Momo's 'Martial Peak'</title><link>https://cosmiccoding.com.au/reviews/martial_peak/</link><pubDate>Tue, 10 Jan 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://cosmiccoding.com.au/reviews/martial_peak/</guid><description>As of writing this review, I have read &amp;gt;1500 chapters of the manhua.
Blurb The journey to the martial peak is a lonely, solitary and long one. In the face of adversity, you must survive and remain unyielding. Only then can you break through and continue on your journey to become the strongest. Sky Tower tests its disciples in the harshest ways to prepare them for this journey. One day the lowly sweeper Yang Kai managed to obtain a black book, setting him on the road to the peak of the martial world.</description></item><item><title>A review of Zamil Akhtar's Lightblade</title><link>https://cosmiccoding.com.au/reviews/lightblade/</link><pubDate>Sun, 05 Jun 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://cosmiccoding.com.au/reviews/lightblade/</guid><description>Disclosure: I received this book in advance and without cost in exchange for an honest review. Counter-disclosure: I already pay for KU, so I would have been able to read it for &amp;lsquo;free&amp;rsquo; anyway.
Initially, the premise of this book seemed super intense. Lightblades obviously give you some Star Wars vibes, the magic system is focused around different wavelengths of light, which gives me Lightbringer vibes, and then the focus on dreams, time-dilation, and the existential question &amp;ldquo;Is this the real world&amp;rdquo; combine Inception and the Matrix.</description></item><item><title>A review of K.T. Hanna's 'Somnia Online'</title><link>https://cosmiccoding.com.au/reviews/somnia/</link><pubDate>Thu, 23 Jun 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://cosmiccoding.com.au/reviews/somnia/</guid><description>I&amp;rsquo;m writing this review as of reading the first three books. I&amp;rsquo;ll update it when I finish the series at a later date.
Somnia Online follows the journey of Wren, her best friend Harlow, and their guild, Fable. The premise, at the start, is simple. Wren&amp;rsquo;s mother is the lead designer for a massive vrmmo game, which offers unparalleled immersive via a headset which reads your brainwaves. Except, of course, the game is really just a test bed for the development for the games AI and the headset technology, which is funded by the military.</description></item><item><title>A Review of Noret Flood's 'The Legend of Randidly Ghosthound', a great take on system takeover LitRPG.</title><link>https://cosmiccoding.com.au/reviews/randidly_ghosthound/</link><pubDate>Fri, 28 Jan 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://cosmiccoding.com.au/reviews/randidly_ghosthound/</guid><description>Note: I&amp;rsquo;ve read the Amazon Book One, and then Royal Road chapters up to around Chapter 300 (ie many books worth). This review uses all of the content I&amp;rsquo;ve read, but I&amp;rsquo;ll make sure to separate book vs royal road if you&amp;rsquo;re thinking of buying. Actually, scrap that, just buy the first book, its great, and then continue on RR if you want.
So let&amp;rsquo;s begin with the basic premise. Earth is taken over by the System, and it becomes an effective post-apocalypse LitRPG adventure, which is fairly normal for the genre.</description></item><item><title>A Review of Chris Fox's Shattered Gods series.

Xal is a child of the dims, an oppressed group of people feared by the ruling class and used as cannon fodder. Xal gets conscripted and sent to tie in the trash legion, and the adventures of this legion, plus the Academy afterwards, show him progressing in power and being inducted into the wider political landscape, wherein he has very few friends and a great many enemies.</description></item><item><title>A Review of Dakota Krout's Divine Dungeon Series.</title><link>https://cosmiccoding.com.au/reviews/divine_dungeon/</link><pubDate>Wed, 03 Feb 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://cosmiccoding.com.au/reviews/divine_dungeon/</guid><description>This is another series I&amp;rsquo;ve read which I got instantly hooked on with a great premise, only to feel a bit let down at the conclusion many books later.
That said, I&amp;rsquo;ve read this series more than once, so it must be doing something right!
The Divine Dungeon series was my introduction to dungeon-core novels, and for that, I thank you, Dakota Krout.

Itâ€™s hard to be a drunken idiot when the world keeps burning down around you. Cairn, the charming-yet-utterly-irresponsible heir to the Uskarrion throne, is all too happy to toss the crown aside. But an invasion, conspiracy, and rise of a terrifying villain result in his untimely death.
Then, Cairn reawakens. It&amp;rsquo;s a decade earlier and he&amp;rsquo;s in his childhood body.</description></item><item><title>A Review of Jame A. Hunter's Rogue Dungeon.

Roark von Graf lives in a fantasy world, trying to overthrow a tyrant. By weird magic, he is teleported into an Earth video game into a troll&amp;rsquo;s body, and his goal is to get back to his world with enough power to overthrow the tyrant.
It&amp;rsquo;s a weird premise, having the MC not be a normal Earthman, but still having them inhabit an Earth video game where player characters are regular people.</description></item><item><title>A Review of Travis Bagwell's Awaken Online.

The series is ongoing.
To kick things off, if you like overpowered main characters and don&amp;rsquo;t mind game systems or balances that blatantly favour the protagonist, you&amp;rsquo;ll enjoy this series a lot.
If you&amp;rsquo;re on the fence, I&amp;rsquo;d highly recommend reading at least the first book. It&amp;rsquo;s definitely the best of the ones that I&amp;rsquo;ve read so far.</description></item><item><title>A Review of Shirtaloon's He Who Fights With Monsters, a great LitRPG with an opinionated protagonist.</title><link>https://cosmiccoding.com.au/reviews/hwfwm/</link><pubDate>Tue, 02 Mar 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://cosmiccoding.com.au/reviews/hwfwm/</guid><description>Jason, our MC, is simultaneously this series greatest strengths and greatest weakness.
Transported to a magical world, Jason is thrown into some truly unfortunate circumstances right off the bat. Weirdly there&amp;rsquo;s very little detail given about Jason and his past life, apart from a few vague comments about it not exactly being ideal (I mean, he was Australian, just like me, so points for that), but there&amp;rsquo;s no time to dwell on that as Jason struggles to survive against a host of organisations, beasts, and eventually eldritch horrors.</description></item><item><title>A Review of Zogarth's LitRPG 'The Primal Hunter'</title><link>https://cosmiccoding.com.au/reviews/primal_hunter/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://cosmiccoding.com.au/reviews/primal_hunter/</guid><description>I&amp;rsquo;m just going to come out and say it. If you&amp;rsquo;ve read Defiance of the Fall and enjoyed it, you will love The Primal Hunter. It has a similar premise, similar (minimal) base-building and progression, but with better characters and less deus ex machina.
Now, to be fair, the author gets away with a lot on the social side of characterisation by making the main character incredibly anti-social, and then befriending a pair of (sentient) birds.</description></item><item><title>A review of Benjamin Kerei's 'Oh Great!

The premise of the book is fairly simple. Through some unfortunate accident, the MC (Arnold) is taken from Earth and his job as a semi-pro gamer, and reincarnated in the body of a farmer. The world has levels and a class based system (without it being a &amp;lsquo;capital S&amp;rsquo; system), and classes can&amp;rsquo;t be changed.</description></item><item><title>A Review of Sarah Lin's The Brightest Shadow - great subversion of a genre trope.</title><link>https://cosmiccoding.com.au/reviews/brightest_shadow/</link><pubDate>Fri, 07 Jan 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://cosmiccoding.com.au/reviews/brightest_shadow/</guid><description>Disclaimer: the thoughts in this review come from reading only the first book of the series. I have not read &amp;lsquo;A Hollow Mountain&amp;rsquo;, yet.
I enjoyed the read of The Brightest Shadow a few weeks ago during my end of year holiday. I&amp;rsquo;d been slowly making my way through the novel for a month or so before that, as I initially struggled with the slower pacing of the work. In that way, it reminds me a lot of A Thousand Li (in that I struggled with the slice-of-life plodding along).</description></item><item><title>A Review of Andrew Seiple's Threadbare.

I will admit to some skepticism when I read the original premise - the main character is a stuffed bear.
But, in a fit of whimsy, I thought I&amp;rsquo;d give it a shot.
This was, as it turns out, a wonderful decision.
Threadbare follows the journey of the eponymous bear&amp;rsquo;s quest to try and find and save the daughter of his creator and his best friend - Cecelia Gearheart.</description></item><item><title>A Review of Yrsillar's Forge of Destiny</title><link>https://cosmiccoding.com.au/reviews/forge_of_destiny/</link><pubDate>Wed, 26 May 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://cosmiccoding.com.au/reviews/forge_of_destiny/</guid><description>Forge of Destiny starts like many cultivation novels. Plucky young girl from the streets, Ling Qi, has the talent and joins the Sect of Argent Peak. She then struggles to rise up in the inner rankings of the Sect. It has your normal progression systems, spiritual pills, removing impurities, it has moves and techniques, a vide cast of characters, but at the end of the day I wasn&amp;rsquo;t drawn in.</description></item><item><title>A Review of 'Defiance of the Fall', a system-apocalypse LitRPG / cultivation hybrid.</title><link>https://cosmiccoding.com.au/reviews/defiance_of_the_fall/</link><pubDate>Fri, 25 Mar 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://cosmiccoding.com.au/reviews/defiance_of_the_fall/</guid><description>As of the time of writing this review, I have read all four books on KU, and a further 200 chapters on RR, up to and including the time skip.
So Defiance of the Fall did hook me in, and the author is great at leaving each chapter with a teaser, cliffhanger, or something to get you thinking &amp;ldquo;Okay, just one more.&amp;rdquo; It had the same vibes as when I&amp;rsquo;m playing Civilisation, and it&amp;rsquo;s why I ended up reading several million words before I put the story down.</description></item><item><title>A review of Michael Nwanolue's 'The Tower Unbroken'</title><link>https://cosmiccoding.com.au/reviews/tower_unbroken/</link><pubDate>Wed, 07 Sep 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://cosmiccoding.com.au/reviews/tower_unbroken/</guid><description>I do like me a good cultivation story, and so when I asked for some recommendations and someone pointed out that there is a little-known work featuring African-inspired cultivation, I put it to the top of my list.

I had high expectations for this book. As a physicist myself, a book about a physicist using the scientific method to put some hard rules to magic and delve into the mechanics had me almost giddy with excitement. So I dove into this book, and, I&amp;rsquo;ll be frank, came away disappointed.
The book follows the MC, Will. In another fun coincidence, Will works at Fermilab in Chicago.</description></item><item><title>A review of Samer Rabadi's 'Eight'</title><link>https://cosmiccoding.com.au/reviews/eight/</link><pubDate>Tue, 22 Nov 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://cosmiccoding.com.au/reviews/eight/</guid><description>Blurb Lifeâ€™s tough when youâ€™re trapped in an eight-year-old body on another world.

There are plenty of authors who add positively to this community that I can support instead of someone who tries to tear it down.
I had heard great things about this series, and A Thousand Li is a staple on the cultivation and progression fantasy reading lists. So take this review with a grain of salt, that obviously my take here may not be reflective of the wider community.</description></item><item><title>A Review of Chugong's Solo Levelling - an engaging take on the genre.</title><link>https://cosmiccoding.com.au/reviews/solo_levelling/</link><pubDate>Sat, 08 Jan 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://cosmiccoding.com.au/reviews/solo_levelling/</guid><description>Note: this review is based off the novel. I have heard the manhua doesn&amp;rsquo;t have many of the issues I&amp;rsquo;ve pointed out and recommend reading that instead.
Here&amp;rsquo;s the rough premise of Solo Levelling. The world was all normal, but now dungeon gates open, and teams of hunters have to enter, clear the dungeon and kill its boss. This will ensure the gates close. If they don&amp;rsquo;t close it in a week, the dungeon monsters can escape.</description></item><item><title>A Review of Brent Weeks' Lightbringer Series.

The first three books of this series were amazing. Watching Kip, our main character, be bought from his destroyed village to the Chromeria, train with the Blackguard, develop his chromaturgy fantastic. Watching Gavin* build the Brightwater Wall in the face of the oncoming army of the Color Prince, gripping. Koios White Oak and her growth out of the Blackguard, superb.

Is it sensible? Is it serious? Is it consistent?
No.

You might have a nice long list of operations, and then interupt it like so:
df = ( df_raw.set_index(&amp;#34;A&amp;#34;) .sort_index() .unstack() .groupby(&amp;#34;B&amp;#34;) .mean() ) df = df[df[&amp;#34;C&amp;#34;] == &amp;#34;some_value&amp;#34;] df = df.join(df2).reset_index() I&amp;rsquo;m a simple man, and I just want everything in a single chain!
Yes, in the trivial example above, you could just move the indexor into the chain, but what if you need to filter based a value in the dataframe at that instant, not in the raw dataframe?</description></item><item><title>Scion of Storms Art</title><link>https://cosmiccoding.com.au/blogs/darian_nexus/</link><pubDate>Tue, 25 Oct 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://cosmiccoding.com.au/blogs/darian_nexus/</guid><description>I commissioned a settings piece from the amazing Richard Lay and I cannot stress how amazing it is.

For those may have misclicked: it&amp;rsquo;s a website where authors publish web serials, generally a chapter at a time, and generally at a freakishly fast pace (like one chapter a day). It&amp;rsquo;s home to many greats in the Progression Fantasy / LitRPG genre, and I have spent hundreds of hours as a consumer of these serials.
So I decided to try and extract some insights from Royal Road data about how page count, followers, ratings, etc, impact the serials success and patreon conversion.</description></item><item><title>Scion of Storms Prologue</title><link>https://cosmiccoding.com.au/blogs/scion_of_storms_prologue/</link><pubDate>Thu, 22 Sep 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://cosmiccoding.com.au/blogs/scion_of_storms_prologue/</guid><description>Manifestation, Book Two, is now in editing!

To that end, in my role as one of the technical leads (responsible for the data pipeline and ingestion), I created out a simple (and no-risk) data product simply containing a list of our participant sites, and how many patients they have enrolled in our study at a given date.</description></item><item><title>Training a Neural Network Embedding Layer with Keras</title><link>https://cosmiccoding.com.au/tutorials/encoding_colours/</link><pubDate>Sun, 26 Jul 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://cosmiccoding.com.au/tutorials/encoding_colours/</guid><description>This little write is designed to try and explain what embeddings are, and how we can train a naive version of an embedding to understand and visualise the process. We&amp;rsquo;ll do this using a colour dataset, Keras and good old-fashioned matplotlib.
Introduction Let&amp;rsquo;s start simple: What is an embedding?
An embedding is a way to represent some categorical feature (like a word), as a dense parameter. Specifically, this is normally a unit vector in a high dimensional hypersphere.</description></item><item><title>Gource - Visualisating Code Contributions</title><link>https://cosmiccoding.com.au/tutorials/gource/</link><pubDate>Fri, 17 Jul 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://cosmiccoding.com.au/tutorials/gource/</guid><description>What is Gource? Gource is a way of visualising your git log, showing users and their contributions creating, modifying and deleting files. When run on my repository that was published under the name &amp;ldquo;Steve&amp;rdquo; (a Hierarchical Bayesian model for supernova cosmology&amp;quot;) and then piped through ffmpeg, this is what we get:

In many cases, this is fine, because they are both providing information on the general question &amp;ldquo;How good is my classifier?&amp;rdquo;. But like many things which are often fine to do, there are cases where we&amp;rsquo;d want to specifically show either a PR or ROC curve.
So in the next few sections, we&amp;rsquo;ll generate a mock dataset, generate PR and ROC curves for them for two different classifiers, go into the definition of both of PR and ROC curves (both the intuition and mathematics), and then we&amp;rsquo;ll go how they subtly differ with another code example.</description></item><item><title>An Introduction to Logistic Regression</title><link>https://cosmiccoding.com.au/tutorials/logistic_regression/</link><pubDate>Sat, 11 Jul 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://cosmiccoding.com.au/tutorials/logistic_regression/</guid><description>In this small write up, we&amp;rsquo;ll cover logistic functions, probabilities vs odds, logit functions, and how to perform logistic regression in Python.
Logistic regression is a method of calculating the probability that an event will pass or fail. That is, we utilise it for dichotomous results - 0 and 1, pass or fail. Is this patient going to survive or not? Is this email spam or not? This is specifically called binary logistic regression, and is important to note because we can do logistic regression in other contexts.</description></item><item><title>Introduction to Naive Bayes</title><link>https://cosmiccoding.com.au/tutorials/naivebayes/</link><pubDate>Sat, 11 Jul 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://cosmiccoding.com.au/tutorials/naivebayes/</guid><description>Naive Bayes is a simple, extraordinarily fast, and incredibly useful categorical classification tool. The underlying crux of Naive Bayes is that we assume feature independence, plug it into Bayes theorem, and the math that falls out is incredibly simple.
The background math Let&amp;rsquo;s start with the famous Bayes Theorem:
$$ P(Y|X) = \frac{P(X|Y)P(Y)}{P(X)} $$
On the left hand side, we have the posterior: the probability of the output given the input.</description></item><item><title>Evolution of US COVID-19 cases</title><link>https://cosmiccoding.com.au/tutorials/us_covid_evolution/</link><pubDate>Thu, 09 Jul 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://cosmiccoding.com.au/tutorials/us_covid_evolution/</guid><description>This plot was first inspired by this absolute masterpiece of a visualisation. I was chatting with David Morton about how much work it must have taken (coding up textures, exporting to blender, creating the model, rendering, compositing, loading back into code, annotating, so much work). David then went and created a python only version of the plot, and I decided I&amp;rsquo;d give it a crack too.

DatascienceGo is one of those conferences, and I was invited to give a workshop on datascience pipelines. This invite comes off the back of some discussions and media about my role in the COVID-19 Critical Care Consortium and creating their data processing pipeline, which has been a challenging project.
For the workshop, I thought it best to try and generalise the content slightly, and instead of talking about all the different things you can do to data and the headaches we&amp;rsquo;ve had to deal with, to instead talk about machine learning and how you can add tracking and logging to your processes super simply using the amazing mlflow library.</description></item><item><title>A visual tutorial of Inversion Sampling</title><link>https://cosmiccoding.com.au/tutorials/inversion_sampling/</link><pubDate>Fri, 19 Jun 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://cosmiccoding.com.au/tutorials/inversion_sampling/</guid><description>Inversion sampling is a simple and very efficient way to generate samples of some arbitrary probability function.

$$ P(x) = 2 x $$
between 0 and 1. It just happens this does integrate to 1, what luck!

So, give me a few seconds to try and espouse their virtues. First, if you are new to decorators, how they work is simple: they are a function that returns a function which has wrapped another function. Simple!
It&amp;rsquo;s easier to explain in code.
def decorator(fn): def wrapper(*args, **kwargs): print(&amp;#34;Look, I&amp;#39;ve added something here!&amp;#34;) return fn(*args, **kwargs) return wrapper @decorator def add(a, b): return a + b add(1, 2) Look, I've added something here!</description></item><item><title>One Line Python Singletons</title><link>https://cosmiccoding.com.au/tutorials/simple_singletons/</link><pubDate>Thu, 18 Jun 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://cosmiccoding.com.au/tutorials/simple_singletons/</guid><description>Singletons are the idea that you want to get an instance of a class, but you only ever want there to be a single instance of that class instantiated.

No integration, no trickery, you simply trade computational efficiency away to keep everything as simple as possible.
Let&amp;rsquo;s pick a super simple example: let&amp;rsquo;s say you want to sample from the function
$$ f(x) = 1.2 - x^4 $$

Supernova cosmology works because Type Ia supernova represent standardisable candles. That is, with a few factors taken into account, they are essentially all the same brightness. Which means, if we see two supernovae, and one is four times dimmer than the other, it must be twice as far away.</description></item><item><title>Cosmology on Safari</title><link>https://cosmiccoding.com.au/blogs/southafrica/</link><pubDate>Fri, 01 Mar 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://cosmiccoding.com.au/blogs/southafrica/</guid><description>Every two years the amazing Cosmology on Safari conference is held.

What they might be, why we believe so strongly that they exist</description></item><item><title>Astronomy at Gumdale</title><link>https://cosmiccoding.com.au/blogs/gumdale/</link><pubDate>Fri, 19 Oct 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://cosmiccoding.com.au/blogs/gumdale/</guid><description>Astronomy is great fun. So is coding. At least to me. But, I was invited to talk at Gumdale State School, I decided that it would be good to spread the good message out there and drum up some enthusiasm for space, science and STEM in general.
I think the trick with younger students is to constantly ask questions and get input, because talking for an hour at them will either put them to sleep or make them so restless you might as well not be talking, so that&amp;rsquo;s what I did.</description></item><item><title>Setting up a scientific python environment</title><link>https://cosmiccoding.com.au/blogs/anaconda/</link><pubDate>Mon, 30 Jul 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://cosmiccoding.com.au/blogs/anaconda/</guid><description>This writeup is primarily for the students of PHYS3080 at UQ, however it should be generally applicable. Firstly, let&amp;rsquo;s get the obvious out of the way. It&amp;rsquo;s 2018. Python 2.7 is dead. Long live Python 3!
Getting a Python Environment Up And Running So let&amp;rsquo;s get a nice python 3 environment set up. Don&amp;rsquo;t google python 3, that would be crazy. Use Anaconda. So head here to download it, and pick the Python 3 version, 64 bits.</description></item><item><title>Hidden Treasure</title><link>https://cosmiccoding.com.au/blogs/gold/</link><pubDate>Fri, 09 Feb 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://cosmiccoding.com.au/blogs/gold/</guid><description>With the Keva simulation I made, all the blocks are spaced out with room to move. I was curious to see how Blender&amp;rsquo;s engine would cope when the blocks were tightly packed, so, surprise surprise, I made a group of tightly packed cubes and then threw a glass sphere at them.
I randomised the materials of the cubes to add some spice, and fiddled around with simulation speed to get a slow motion section of the simulation.</description></item><item><title>The Tower of Two Blocks</title><link>https://cosmiccoding.com.au/blogs/keva/</link><pubDate>Thu, 08 Feb 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://cosmiccoding.com.au/blogs/keva/</guid><description>Seeing KEVA simulations always makes my day brighter, so I thought I&amp;rsquo;d make a small one myself. This one has a series of very light wood blocks set on top some very heavy metal blocks as the base. Two steel balls are shot at the structure, and if you watch the video you can probably guess which of them is solid and which is simply a thin shell over a hollow interior!</description></item><item><title>Solar System Size Scale</title><link>https://cosmiccoding.com.au/blogs/planets/</link><pubDate>Tue, 06 Feb 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://cosmiccoding.com.au/blogs/planets/</guid><description>{% include youtube.html url=&amp;ldquo;https://www.youtube.com/embed/JNPACDLSCTY)
This was a scene in which I learnt a lot, not just about compositing. Lots of fiddling with materials, mapping and textures to get the rocky planets working.
And then even more fiddling for the Gas Giants, to try and get that characteristic atmospheric effect along the boundary of the planet surface.
Setting up Saturn&amp;rsquo;s ring was a pain with the UV mapping, but eventually got it working!</description></item><item><title>Coloured Smoke</title><link>https://cosmiccoding.com.au/blogs/colorsmoke/</link><pubDate>Mon, 29 Jan 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://cosmiccoding.com.au/blogs/colorsmoke/</guid><description>So I wanted to see how the soft body physics worked. So alright, lets just drop a ball. But a bouncing ball is boring, so lets squash it completely. And because I could, why not have particles emit when the bottom of the ball impacts and have them shoot out.
And then because that was still dull, what if we tie the velocity of the smoke into its colour, and have it that the more dense the smoke is, the more it glows and emits light.</description></item><item><title>Gas Explosion</title><link>https://cosmiccoding.com.au/blogs/explosion/</link><pubDate>Mon, 29 Jan 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://cosmiccoding.com.au/blogs/explosion/</guid><description>It turns out that smoke simulations both take far, far longer than rigid body simulations, but also take up a lot of disk space as well. So I might have accidentally filled my main C drive on which Windows lives and had all sort of complaints come screetching out of the operating systems.
In this sim I was just trying to figure out how the volumetic shaders worked, such that I could get a two stage explosion with thick, greasy smoke.</description></item><item><title>Glowing Galton Board</title><link>https://cosmiccoding.com.au/blogs/galton/</link><pubDate>Tue, 23 Jan 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://cosmiccoding.com.au/blogs/galton/</guid><description>It&amp;rsquo;s been years since I last tried out 3D modelling and simulations. And given how crushing my PhD workload is at this point in time, I realised I needed something on the side to distract me so that my project didn&amp;rsquo;t consume all of my life.
So, after seeing the constant posts about Blender on Reddits /r/simulated sub, I decided to give it a go. Following the current hot topic (so that if anything went wrong there would be plenty of people able to help out), I decided to go with a classic Galton board simulation.</description></item><item><title>readr 2017</title><link>https://cosmiccoding.com.au/blogs/readr/</link><pubDate>Thu, 14 Dec 2017 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://cosmiccoding.com.au/blogs/readr/</guid><description>Nearing the tail end of the year I got a wonderful opportunity to expand the work I had been doing with my coding workshops to also take them to the 2017 readr retreat. readr - a research education and development retreat - is open to all undergraduate physics students in Australia, not just astrophysics students.

Fiona and I were talking to Elaine about the problems we have had with the self-taught style of coding the most astronomers work with, specifically the lack of structure, documentation and testing that so often accompanies astronomical projects and packages.
To fix this, we volunteered to run a code workshop, with a focus on teaching the astronomical community better coding standards, better practises, giving them better tools and better resources.</description></item><item><title>Desert Caves Map</title><link>https://cosmiccoding.com.au/blogs/map-caves/</link><pubDate>Sun, 17 Sep 2017 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://cosmiccoding.com.au/blogs/map-caves/</guid><description>Presenting, some desert caves, cave system, lava basin, dubiously engineered bridges, and small encampment! The idea for this one was after climbing down the hole in the previous map you would end up in the top right corner of this map.
Once again, following the style of Mark Bowen&amp;rsquo;s maps over at Blue Sword Games.
So, for this map, here are the outlines and grid versions:

Once again, following the style of Mark Bowen&amp;rsquo;s maps over at Blue Sword Games, my second desert map.
I decided I wanted the map to have a few potential uses.
Make camp, and be ambused from outside, and use the cave choke point to hold them off. Have creatures ascend from the hole and attack the camp from inside the cave.</description></item><item><title>Desert Canyon Map</title><link>https://cosmiccoding.com.au/blogs/map-canyon/</link><pubDate>Wed, 13 Sep 2017 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://cosmiccoding.com.au/blogs/map-canyon/</guid><description>Presenting, a desert canyon, with included creek, small rock pillars, and larger overhanging boulder, for your consideration!

Or perhaps I am simply bad at saying &amp;ldquo;No!&amp;rdquo;
The moral of the story is that I took over makign the Taipan logo for the Taipan survey.

It was a GPU accelerated 2D light transport simulator, and I spent at least an hour playing around with it and producing some beautiful caustics. But with Tantalum, you can only control the position and angle of the light source - the rest of the scene was static.</description></item><item><title>Making bismuth crystals</title><link>https://cosmiccoding.com.au/blogs/bismuth/</link><pubDate>Mon, 27 Feb 2017 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://cosmiccoding.com.au/blogs/bismuth/</guid><description>Josh Calcino and I were in Japan on a holiday recently, and we spent a fair bit of time in some of the larger crystal shops they had in Kyoto - we both collected crystals when we were younger.

So in January 2017, I went to Japan. First stop, Mt Fuji.
After Fuji, straight to Kyoto. We went to a few of the shrines, the Silver and Golden Palaces, and the Fushimi Inari Shrine.
I didn&amp;rsquo;t quite realise how big the Fushimi Inari Shrine was - its not just one or two arches, there are kilometers of them.</description></item><item><title>An Evening with Dr Lisa Randall</title><link>https://cosmiccoding.com.au/blogs/lisa/</link><pubDate>Thu, 17 Nov 2016 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://cosmiccoding.com.au/blogs/lisa/</guid><description>In November 2016, Lisa Randall gave an Australian tour in the big cities.

The slightly wiggles you can see around $$k=0.1 \rm{h/Mpc}$$ below, when transformed into a correlation function via the Spherical Hankel transformation, turn into that big peak in the right hand plot. As you may have guessed, said &amp;ldquo;big peak&amp;rdquo; is the oscillation of interest. Put simply, it represents a characteristic separation at which there is an overdensity of matter in the universe. And its of interest because this peak has existed since the first galaxies formed, and so we can use it as a standard ruler.</description></item><item><title>Kubo Oscillator</title><link>https://cosmiccoding.com.au/blogs/kubo/</link><pubDate>Thu, 20 Aug 2015 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://cosmiccoding.com.au/blogs/kubo/</guid><description>I&amp;rsquo;ll be honest: this post was made just to show of one of my favourite plots.

Firstly, a terrifying brief (and thus completely inaccurate) introduction to stochastic systems: A stochastic system is one in which the outcome of an individual system is unpredictable due to the effect of randomness.
Brownian motion (the motion of a particle being jostled around by other particles) is the classic example of this.</description></item><item><title>Overland Track - Tasmania</title><link>https://cosmiccoding.com.au/blogs/tasmania/</link><pubDate>Thu, 01 Jan 2015 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://cosmiccoding.com.au/blogs/tasmania/</guid><description>After uni was over one year, Julia told me she was thinking of doing the overland track in Tasmania.

Mechanically, this is simple, the flick just needs to be connected to a DC motor switch, such that either side of the switch changes the voltage across the motor.</description></item><item><title>Mood Bottle</title><link>https://cosmiccoding.com.au/blogs/bottle/</link><pubDate>Wed, 01 Jun 2011 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://cosmiccoding.com.au/blogs/bottle/</guid><description>The image you see was sourced from a similar Instructibles that I recommend you check out.
Unfortunately, I can find no images of my own creation. It was made in 2011, in the basement of my grandparent&amp;rsquo;s house. The pictures I took were on an old phone, long since gone.
So, I&amp;rsquo;ll simply explain what I did, and hope I can find actual images in the future.
The recipe goes as follows:</description></item><item><title>The Blue Planet</title><link>https://cosmiccoding.com.au/blogs/planet/</link><pubDate>Thu, 23 Sep 2010 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://cosmiccoding.com.au/blogs/planet/</guid><description>I created this image using a ton of brushes, layers, stacking and this texture.</description></item><item><title>Lightning Strike</title><link>https://cosmiccoding.com.au/blogs/lightning/</link><pubDate>Sun, 19 Sep 2010 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://cosmiccoding.com.au/blogs/lightning/</guid><description>This photoshop challenge was for me to try and figure out the basics of photomanipulation. I started with a bunch of images and textures, and turned them into what you see below.

And every single time I finish refamiliarising myself with 3DS, sometimes crops up, and I don&amp;rsquo;t come back to it for a year.
Here is the last time I managed to get something properly tangible. From 2009 I believe. The original files are long lost to computer failure. All that is left are these images, rendered out quickly at low resolution abut three quarters of the way through the design.</description></item></channel></rss>
